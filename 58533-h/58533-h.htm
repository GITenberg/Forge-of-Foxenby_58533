<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
The County Schools' Final
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"A goal!"
</p>

<p>
"Straight from the kick-off&mdash;a goal!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, played, St. Cuthbert's!  One up!  Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!" came the delighted
chorus of congratulations from Cuthbertians in all parts
of the field.
</p>

<p>
But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the
net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon
chickens still in the shell.  There was a youth behind
the Foxenby posts with a muddy mark on the side
of his face, and he at least knew no goal had been
scored.
</p>

<p>
The first shot of the match had flashed by the
upright&mdash;on the wrong side of it for St. Cuthbert's, on
the right side of it for Foxenby, whose sigh of heart-felt
relief was audible when their rivals' untimely cheers
had died down.
</p>

<p>
"A narrow squeak, old man!" said Dick Forge, the
captain of the Foxenby team, to Broome, the
inside-left, selected from Holbeck's House.
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" answered Broome.  "It quite turned
my heart over.  Their centre's got his shooting-boots
on this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Helped by the wind, of course.  It's buzzing
across from goal to goal.  Feel the pressure of it!
Like running up against a house-side."
</p>

<p>
"We'll never get going against it, Captain.  They'll
be a dozen goals up at half-time."
</p>

<p>
"Fudge!" cried the captain.  "They've got Lebberston
and Lyon&mdash;grand old Lyon&mdash;to beat first, and
Ennis after that.  Throw your chest out, Broome, old
man, and smile!"
</p>

<p>
Dick's laughing face was a tonic to the faint-hearted
ones always.  However dark the picture seemed to be,
he had the happy knack of turning it to the light so that
his chums could see something cheery in it.
</p>

<p>
To-day they had much need of his enthusiasm, too.
By calling "heads" as the referee span a coin in the
air, when it would have been much nicer had he said
"tails ", he had passed the luck of the toss to the rival
captain, who thankfully grabbed the chance of placing
a spanking sea-breeze at the back of his team.
</p>

<p>
Hard lines indeed, you Foxenby fellows, to lose the
toss in a wind like this, and on such a very important
day.  For you have worked your way through to the
final tie of the County Schools' Cup against teams of
stronger build, only to meet, in the last match, eleven
sturdy youths who outweigh you almost man for man.
</p>

<p>
Forge and Lyon alone can be said to be up to the
average bulk of your opponents.  Ennis, your trusty
goalkeeper, is certainly tall, but see how thin he looks!
Almost like a third goalpost, you might say.  Your
forwards are fleet-footed to a man, and your halves are
like terriers, ever worrying the foe.
</p>

<p>
But you can't get away from the fact that weight
plays a big part in footer, and when a mass of bone
and brawn has half a gale behind it to help it
whenever it charges you, why, phew! you need all the
pluck you can muster to pick yourselves up and start
in afresh!
</p>

<p>
"St. Cuthbert's are a dandy side this season,"
remarked a young Cuthbertian behind the Foxenby goal.
"Scored twenty-three times in the Cup-ties up to
date, and never once had a goal notched against them."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, they'll blot their copy-books this
afternoon, if never before," retorted Robin Arkness, a
Foxenby Junior, who had gathered round him a little
cluster of select pals, and was in a mood to blow his
own side's trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Who's going to score against them, anyhow?"
asked the perky Cuthbertian youngster.
</p>

<p>
"Forge will, Broome will, perhaps even old Lyon
will, from full-back, given half a chance," declared the
optimistic Robin.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  They can't even cross the half-way line,"
snorted the champion of St. Cuthbert's,
contemptuously.  "See how we're peppering your goalie all the
time.  Play up, Saints!  Bang 'em in, boys!  Oo&mdash;ooo,
a goal&mdash;no, hang it, only a corner!  Allow for the
wind, Monty&mdash;allow for the wind!"
</p>

<p>
"You mean 'allow for the gas', don't you, kid?"
asked Robin.  "You're a tip-topper at scoring goals
with your tongue."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the cocksure young Cuthbertian had
every reason for his confidence.  Already there were
many ominous smudges of mud on the newly-whitewashed
goalposts and crossbar, and a series of finely-placed
corner-kicks had only been hustled away by
what seemed to be desperate scrimmages of the Rugby
order, with the luck on Foxenby's side.
</p>

<p>
The impartial crowd of Walsbridge townspeople,
on whose ground the final tie was being played, had
read wonderful accounts of the Cuthbertians' rock-like
defence&mdash;it delighted them to see that these hefty
youths knew also the straight route to an opponent's
goal.  Therefore, they began by wishing Ennis, the
goalkeeper of the "Foxes", good luck, and plenty of
hard work!
</p>

<p>
They flocked behind his goal, cheering him again
and again as he flung himself backwards and forwards
to fist away corking shots, some of which he probably
knew very little about, though it just happened that his
long body was always in the way.  The better the
goal-keeper, the more good fortune he enjoys as a rule.
Forwards seem somehow magnetized into shooting
where he is.
</p>

<p>
"How about that hatful of goals your team were
going to score?" Robin Arkness wanted to know, after
twenty minutes of this sort of thing.  "Rather
overlooked the fact that our side had a goalkeeper, didn't
you, Cuthbert kid?"
</p>

<p>
"He kept that last one out by a sheer fluke,"
grumbled the young Cuthbertian.  "See, there he goes
again, bobbing the ball away with his eyes shut."
</p>

<p>
"How unkind of him!" said Robin, in mock indignation.
"Ennis, you're a cad, you know, not letting
the nice little Saints add to their twenty-three goals.
Stand aside, you naughty man, while they drive holes
through the net!"
</p>

<p>
But older heads than Robin's were being shaken over
the sore straits in which Foxenby found themselves so
early in the game.  Luke Harwood, the prefect of
Holbeck's House, and editor of the school magazine,
seemed so concerned about it that he voiced his fears
to Roger Cayton, prefect of Rooke's House, whose close
personal friendship with the captain of the team made
him doubly anxious about the way things were going.
</p>

<p>
"Ennis is marvellous," said Luke, "but one-man
shows don't win football matches.  Our halves and
forwards can't even raise a gallop."
</p>

<p>
"That's no surprise, seeing that you and I have to
hold our caps on in the breeze."
</p>

<p>
"Granted, Cayton.  Still, I wouldn't leave all the
donkey-work to Ennis and Lyon if I were captain.
I'd fall back and help."
</p>

<p>
"If you were captain, yes.  But Forge has different
ideas.  Let's give him credit for knowing more about
football than a spectator can."
</p>

<p>
There was a sting in this comment, which Luke
Harwood did not fail to observe.  As editor of the
Foxonian he was unapproachably the school's best
pupil, and so obviously the Head's favourite boy that
he was known throughout both houses as "Old Wykeham's
Pet Fox".  But as a footballer he was "only
middling", and to-day the selection committee had
quietly passed him over.  The pill was a bitter one,
and Roger's comment made it still harder to swallow,
but all he did was to whistle softly and smile.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know the name of the artist who decked
Fluffy Jim, the village idiot, in those stripes of coloured
paper," continued Roger Cayton.  "Club colours, of
course, blue and white stripes.  Still, football
enthusiasm may be carried too far, and such tomfoolery
makes me sick.  What goats the St. Cuthbert's fellows
will think us!"
</p>

<p>
"Pray don't take our little joke too seriously,
Cayton," said Luke, with a pleasant laugh.  "Where's
the big league club that doesn't cart its mascot around
with it on cup days?  Fluffy Jim may bring us luck
and some second-half goals."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, to be sure," snapped Roger.  "Particularly
as St. Cuthbert's have come through to the final
with a clean goal-sheet.  They're the sort of chaps
who would be scared out of their form by a guy in
coloured paper, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
Harwood gave a resigned shrug of his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Funny, isn't it, how the best-laid schemes 'gang
aft agley'?" he commented.  "Some of us thought
that the sight of a mascot in gala garb would serve to
keep the footballing Foxes in good-humour throughout
the game."
</p>

<p>
"It's cheap and nasty," said Roger Cayton, not
without pluck, considering that Luke Harwood could
have made a broken reed of him in physical combat.
"Weakness of intellect is a sorry enough thing in
itself.  A coloured advertisement of it is worse."
</p>

<p>
Composed in manner always, seldom without an
engaging smile, Harwood did not let this half-challenge
pass unnoticed.  There was a gleam in his eyes which
even short-sighted Roger saw.
</p>

<p>
Between these two quick-witted boys existed an
unspoken feud, founded on Harwood's refusal to print
in the Foxonian the contributions which Roger
persisted in sending.  Doubtless Harwood felt that there
was scarcely room in the school magazine for two such
literary stars as he and Roger to shine at the same time.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Harwood, calmly, "sorry if my cronies
and I have given offence.  Our consolation must be
that Fluffy Jim is having the happiest day of his life.
And you fellows may yet come to hail him as a
luck-bringer."
</p>

<p>
"Superstitious piffle, Harwood," Roger grunted,
He and Luke then drifted casually, apart.  Neither
desired to spoil a good football match by bearing each
other company any longer.  Oil and vinegar, these
two!
</p>

<p>
"I have a rotten grain of suspicion in my nature,
doubtless," thought Roger.  "Still, Forge is captain
of the football team and captain of the school&mdash;Luke
Harwood would like to be both, and is neither.  He
knows Dick is strung on wires, and how small a thing
upsets him on big occasions.  This fool idea, then, of
dressing the village idiot like a circus clown&mdash;is there
method in his madness?  Is there a secret hope that
it will put Dick off his game?"
</p>

<p>
Left to himself, the half-witted youth known as
"Fluffy Jim" was as quiet as an old sheep.  Now,
inspired by someone behind the goal, he used his
booming voice to shout out repeatedly, in the dialect
of the district:
</p>

<p>
"Coom back an' keep 'em oot&mdash;coom back, coom
back, afoör they scoöar!"
</p>

<p>
Others&mdash;and some who should have known better&mdash;took
up the cry; but Fluffy Jim's voice rose above the
rest, just as his paper costume was the most
conspicuous thing on the field.
</p>

<p>
"Mascot, indeed!" thought Dick Forge bitterly.
"His ridiculous rig-out gets on my nerves, and now his
voice is doing ditto.  Some kind friend in Holbeck's
House is pulling the strings, I suspect.  Bother it,
how cold and irritable this standing about makes me
feel!"
</p>

<p>
As if to rub it in, his colleagues in the forward line
began imploring him to strengthen the defence.  In
imagination they saw Ennis beaten by every fresh shot
which the determined St. Cuthbert's team fired at the
goal, and it certainly seemed impossible that the tall,
thin youth, who had already done wonders, could hold
the fort much longer.  But Dick Forge refused to be
"rattled".
</p>

<p>
"Don't get the wind up, chaps," he urged.  "If
I'm injured and carried off the field, you can pack the
goal then.  While I'm captain, you won't."
</p>

<p>
"But they've worn our backs to fiddle-strings&mdash;it's
inhuman not to help the poor beggars out," protested
Broome.
</p>

<p>
A grunt was the captain's only reply.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want Cuthbert's to score, Forge?"
continued Broome.
</p>

<p>
It was an ungenerous speech, of which he was
heartily ashamed a moment later.  The captain winced
as he replied:
</p>

<p>
"You're as bad as the rest, Broome.  This is
football&mdash;a game&mdash;a match&mdash;British sport.  Backs defend
goals&mdash;forwards shoot them.  Yes, I want St. Cuthbert's
to score&mdash;if they can!"
</p>

<p>
His sympathy for the defence in their gruelling was
acute, but he shammed indifference to it.  Let the Cup
be lost or won, none should say afterwards that the
Foxes saved their goal by playing one goalkeeper and
ten backs.  Finer to be a dozen goals behind at
half-time than that!
</p>

<p>
"Good old Dick!" shouted Roger from the touch-line.
"Stick to your game, old man!"
</p>

<p>
Dick turned a grateful face in the direction from
which the voice came, and then ran back anxiously as
a great yell of "Penalty, penalty!" came from the
St. Cuthbert's players and spectators alike.
</p>

<p>
"What's happened, Clowes?" he said to the centre-half.
</p>

<p>
"They say that Lyon handled in the penalty-area,"
answered Clowes.  "Hear them bawling at the referee!
Hope to goodness he turns them down."
</p>

<p>
Pushing his way through the crowd of excited
players, the flushed referee ran to consult one of his
linesmen, who shook his head at once.
</p>

<p>
"A pure accident, 'ref.'," he declared.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly what I thought myself, but St. Cuthbert's
were positive that he handled purposely."
</p>

<p>
St. Cuthbert's were very sore about it, too, when the
referee bounced the ball, instead of awarding the
penalty-kick they wanted so.  How very much easier
it would have been to beat the lanky Ennis with an
uninterrupted shot, than when Lyon was circling round
him like an eagle defending its nest!
</p>

<p>
Lyon was too bad&mdash;Lyon had handled purposely,
and he ought to have owned up to it, said the mortified
Cuthbertians.
</p>

<p>
But Lyon the Silent set his teeth and said nothing.
It still wanted ten minutes of half-time, and for that
trying period he meant to save his breath.
</p>

<p>
The crowd swayed backwards and forwards behind
Ennis's goal.  They couldn't keep still, and in their
excitement kicked one another without noticing it.
</p>

<p>
Every player on the St. Cuthbert's side, save only the
goalkeeper, became a sharpshooter.  Each "potted"
Ennis from every angle, allowing him no rest.  The
cross-bar rattled and creaked like the swinging
sign-board of a tavern, and corner-kicks seemed almost as
plentiful as roadside blackberries.  But between the
posts that aggravating ball simply <i>would</i> not go.
</p>

<p>
"Three more minutes, Foxenby&mdash;kick away, kick
away!" yelled Robin Arkness and his frenzied chums.
</p>

<p>
"It's positively sickening," said the young
Cuthbertian, working his shoulders about in sheer agony of
suspense.  "Your chaps have had chunks of luck
thrown at 'em.  We ought to have been sixteen goals
up by now."
</p>

<p>
"And still stick at the old twenty-three," was
Robin's gibe.  "Poor old Saints, such sinners at
shooting!  Hey, hooray!  Forge is on the ball&mdash;Forge is
tivying off to the other end!  Oh, bother!  The wind's
beaten him&mdash;the ball's in touch.  Never mind&mdash;we're
across the half-way line.  All together, you
Foxes&mdash;only a minute more!"
</p>

<p>
"Fibber!" shouted the Junior Cuthbertian.  "It's
two minutes off half-time!"
</p>

<p>
"Blow the dust out of your half-crown watch and
open your ears for the referee's whistle, Cuthy.  He's
got it to his lips now.  He's going to blow.  He has
blown.  Half-time!  Bravo, you jolly Foxes!"
</p>

<p>
"Good old Lyon; played, old Ennis!" shouted the
Foxenby section of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The wild and whirling first-half was indeed over.
"Six&mdash;one" might easily have been the score; <i>"nil&mdash;nil</i>"
it actually was, with the breeze still going strong.
Small wonder that the Foxenby team left the playing
pitch with easier minds, and that the Junior Foxes
grabbed one another frantically and waltzed and
pirouetted round and round the ropes.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
The Captain and "The Octopus"
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was more talk than Forge liked in the cramped
little dressing-room during the interval.  Nevertheless,
he grimly held his tongue while those candid
advisers, whose speciality is winning football matches
with their mouths, put in their interfering oars.
</p>

<p>
"What killed St. Cuthbert's pig was the way their
backs held aloof till the last few minutes," said one.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed another expert.  "If they'd crowded
on all sail like that earlier on, they could have walked
the ball through."
</p>

<p>
"Rather&mdash;by sheer force of numbers," chimed in a
third.
</p>

<p>
"We shan't make that mistake," quoth yet another
oracle.  "Why, even old Ennis will come out of his
hutch and have a pot-shot now and again, won't you,
Ennis?"
</p>

<p>
Ennis might have been part of the furniture for all
the notice he took of this remark.  He just sat back in
the corner, sprawling out his long legs, and breathing
hard.
</p>

<p>
Some of his finger-nails were torn, the backs of his
hands wore long scratches, and his knuckles were
bruised and bleeding.  Smears of mud blackened his
face, which he had not yet found energy to sponge.
Battered knees and swollen shins, too, were part of the
price he had paid for keeping his goal unpierced.  None
but he knew the aches and pains he had endured to
hold the fort for Foxenby.  It would be many a long
day before his skin was free of scars.
</p>

<p>
"Here, old man, have a drink of this," said Forge,
holding to the goalie's lips a cup of coffee.  "Good
stuff, eh?  Buck you up no end.  Alstone, hurry up
with that bowl of warm water.  All St. Cuthbert's have
printed their autographs on Ennis's face."
</p>

<p>
The water was hurriedly brought, and Dick sponged
the goalie's features with it as well as he could, what
time the babel of voices went on uninterruptedly about
them.
</p>

<p>
"What a narrow squeak when Lyon handled!
Looked all over like a penalty to me.  Had they got
it their 'cap.' would have converted&mdash;he never misses
a spot-kick."
</p>

<p>
"If we have a penalty Broome must take it.  He put
three through for Holbeck's in the practice match last
Saturday&mdash;didn't you, Broome?"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" snapped Broome, colouring a little.  He
was still kicking himself for what he had said to Forge
before, and was determined in future to leave
captaincy to the captain.
</p>

<p>
Luke Harwood, too, thought the time ripe for an
exhibition of the good-sportsmanship which he liked
to think was a feature of Holbeck's House.
</p>

<p>
"Outside, you wiseacres," he commanded.  "This is a
dressing-room, not a monkey-house.  Don't burn up the
team's oxygen.  Don't speak to the man at the wheel.
Other 'don'ts' to follow if you don't clear quickly."
</p>

<p>
He bundled out a few Juniors, and, as if by accident,
bustled Roger Cayton too.  Roger flushed and
side-stepped, but said nothing.  He was a slimly-built,
spectacled youth, healthy enough, but physically no
match for boys of his own age.  By pretending to
mistake him for one of the batch of Juniors Luke
Harwood was, Roger believed, deliberately putting a slight
on him.  Still, he pursed his lips and swallowed his
resentment, and the bit of by-play passed unnoticed by
the others.
</p>

<p>
"All ready again, chaps?" asked Forge.  "Come on,
then.  The referee's piping up."
</p>

<p>
Not a word, you will notice, did Forge speak of
encouragement or advice.  They knew better than to
expect "jaw" from him, he being one of those wise
captains who shout instructions only when the necessity
is strong.  He expected them all to do their best
without any nagging, and to use their own wits in an
emergency.
</p>

<p>
"Now we'll put it across you, Cuthy," said Robin
Arkness, as the teams lined up.  "We're after goals,
not 'hard lines' and 'try again, boys!'  You'll be
wanting to creep into a rabbit-hole, Cuthy, before
we've done with you."
</p>

<p>
"Swank!" retorted Cuthy.  "You can't get goals
against St. Cuthbert's; nobody ever does."
</p>

<p>
All the same, the youthful Cuthbertian's voice had
an anxious tremor in it.  He had a lively idea where
all the play was likely to be, for he had never budged
from his excellent standpoint behind the goal.  Nor
had Robin and his chums.  Even the chance of a
warming cup of coffee had failed to lure them away.
The Foxenby "mascot" stuck there, too, grinning
amiably at those who chaffed him about his make-up.
The bulk of the spectators, neutral or otherwise, had
not moved either.  They pulled their overcoats closely
about them, and stamped their feet to nullify the effect
of the cold wind, which still blew straight towards that
particular goal with unabated fury.
</p>

<p>
"Unless they've gotten a goalkeeper as 'wick' as
Foxenby&mdash;which ain't to be expected&mdash;it's all ower
but shoutin'," remarked a Walsbridge rustic.  "Wi' a
wind like this behind me, Ah could scoöar mesen."
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to us, old boy," Robin answered him
complacently.  "You won't have long to wait.  See
that?  Oh, what a top-hole shot, Forge!  An inch
lower, and he'd have been beaten to the 'wide'!"
</p>

<p>
Indeed, for the past ten minutes one continuous roar
of delighted cheering had accompanied Foxenby's
sparkling bombardment of the St. Cuthbert's goal.
Excellent shots went astray by fractions of inches only.
Broome twice nearly did damage to the cross-bar, and
one crafty "balloon" from Forge, over the heads of
a bobbing mass of players, was scooped out of the top
angle of the goal by the keeper's finger-tips only.
Hundreds of hoarse throats yelled "Goal!" prematurely.
It was only a corner, which tall Bessingham, the
six-foot captain of St. Cuthbert's, leapt high to head
away.
</p>

<p>
"Whose toes are you jumping on, clumsy?" grumbled
the Junior Cuthbertian, sourly.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Cuthy&mdash;I couldn't help it," Robin confessed.
"Simply can't keep still.  It's our turn for a
song and dance this half, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Laugh when you've beaten old 'Bess', not before,"
Cuthy cautioned him.
</p>

<p>
There was something in the warning, too.  A
wonderful boy this reed-like, overgrown Bessingham, with
arms always straight to his sides, and legs that seemed
everywhere.  He could use either foot with equal
power, and when his boot caught the ball he made
kicking against the wind seem as simple as kicking with
it.
</p>

<p>
St. Cuthbert's called him "The Octopus", and by
that nickname he was known also to certain Football
League Clubs, who wanted him to play for them when
he left school.
</p>

<p>
A weird, silent player, ever where the ball was, never
seeming to take a useless stride.  Those who saw him
to-day ceased to marvel at St. Cuthbert's feat in reaching
the final tie without yielding a goal.  The
seventeen-year-old footballer was a man in all but age, with
the cool judgment of a veteran to guide his restless legs.
</p>

<p>
"Botheration, I can't dodge him!" panted Broome
to Dick.  "Did you see us mixed together just now?
His legs were round my neck.  It&mdash;it's clammy&mdash;like
having snakes crawling over you."
</p>

<p>
"We've something to learn from him, Broome," said
Dick.  "Single combat won't pay us.  We must work
round his flanks."
</p>

<p>
"Flanks!  Why, he faces all ways," Broome groaned.
"Superman, eh!  Chuck that, Broome&mdash;we've got
to hammer away till we find his weak spot.  Nothing
to fear from the forwards, the wind has them in a
bottle-neck.  Let's drop this first-time shooting stunt,
and try a bit of conjuring."
</p>

<p>
"And he'll juggle better," said Broome, still
despairing.  Then, brightening up a little, he cried
eagerly: "Here, take that centre from Lake; it's a ripe
cherry, Forge!"
</p>

<p>
So it was.  But the Octopus had a taste for ripe
fruit too, and at this particular cherry he had the first
bite.
</p>

<p>
Though Dick made quickly for the outside-right's
fine centre, Bessingham matched him.  Their boots
met the ball together, and the greater force of Bessingham's
kick lifted Dick off his feet.  He sprawled yards
within the penalty-area, with a conviction that
something awkward had happened to his big toe.
</p>

<p>
"Penalty, penalty!" roared some of the crowd.  It
is the habit of football spectators to claim free kicks
when things like this happen.  To eyes blinded by
prejudice it looked as though Dick had been roughly
kicked about, but the players and the referee knew
better.  In a straight-out trial of physical strength, the
sturdy captain of Foxenby had come off second-best.
Moreover, he limped a little as the result, which was
more ominous still.
</p>

<p>
"What did I tell you, kid?" said the Junior
Cuthbertian, taking heart of grace.  "You can't get past
old 'Bess'.  Old Bess is a brick wall.  Old Bess is a
house-side!"
</p>

<p>
"He's a clinking player, I admit," said Robin, "but
who'll pay the doctor's bill if he kicks somebody's
teeth out?"
</p>

<p>
"That's your affair," snapped Cuthy.  "Perhaps
you'd like old Bess to play on crutches to give your
forwards a chance."
</p>

<p>
"He's not All England versus The Rest," retorted
Robin.  "We'll make rings round him yet."
</p>

<p>
Spoken like a true optimist, Robin!  But spectators
cannot win games, however loyal they may be, and
rose-coloured spectacles are as useless in football as in any
other field of activity.  Bluff could not disguise that
the luck had again turned against Foxenby.  The sun
came out and shone in their eyes and the wind suddenly
moderated.  Forwards who had stood idly on the
half-way line (glad enough to rest after their first-half
exertions) now found it possible to pick up Bessingham's
big kicks and move towards Ennis again.  True,
they kept a respectable distance from Lyon and
Lebberston, and only sent in long-range shots with little
powder behind them.  Ennis, ever reliable, hugged
them safely to his breast and punted them back with
ease.  All very well and good; but each movement in
his direction brought relief to St. Cuthbert's defenders,
and cut down Foxenby's scoring chances at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
The gathering behind the top goal thinned a little as
some of the crowd drifted speculatively down the field.
They thought they saw a prospect of a bit of sport at
the other end.  There was always a chance of Ennis's
sun-dazzled eyes failing to judge a straight one,
however languidly the ball were kicked.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the outlook became darker for the Foxes.
Broome appeared to have lost heart and could do
nothing right.  Atack, the inside-right, quite openly
shrank from close contact with the Octopus.  He had
once chanced his arm in a flying charge at Bessingham,
and had been feeling it ever since in the fear that it was
dislocated.  Lake, bothered by the sun, kept missing
his luck entirely and blundering into touch.  All he
could do, it seemed, was to tread down the flags and
inconvenience the linesmen.  Meynard, the swift-footed
outside-left, certainly kept cool, but that was
because he had little to do.  He waited in vain to be
fed by Broome, who seemed always under Bessingham's
feet.
</p>

<p>
It didn't mend matters when the Foxenby halves lost
patience with the men in front of them and commenced
to play hard on top of them.  Not being marksmen,
they drew upon themselves the ironical contempt of the
crowd by shooting high over goal&mdash;"aiming at the
new moon", to quote the gleeful opinion of "Cuthy",
who had once more become offensively cocksure of his
team's abilities.
</p>

<p>
Precious time oozed away while spectators retrieved
the ballooned ball, and all the while Dick's big toe hurt
like toothache.  A pretty kettle of fish all round.
</p>

<p>
Dick had a temper, and came near to losing it
publicly.  Again the maddening voice of the village
idiot began to boom at him.  "Owd can't scoöar!" it
bellowed monotonously.  It had the melancholy effect
of a ship's steam-siren in a fog.  It worried the
sensitive captain more than his damaged toe did.
</p>

<p>
"This is aching misery," he mentally decided.
"Hang it all, I'll waste no more passes on Lake and
Atack.  Fifteen minutes to go, and not a ghost of a
goal in sight.  'Owd can't scoöar' or not, I'll butt
right into the Octopus and chance it."
</p>

<p>
From the moment of this resolve a mighty change
was wrought in the game.  Of combination there was
none, but of vigorous individual action there was a great
deal.  Giving his damaged foot no quarter, using it as
though it were sound, Dick dribbled for goal by the
straightest route, clashing against Bessingham each
time he did so.  It became a battle of giants, almost
too thrilling to those onlookers who favoured one team
more than the other.  Players on both sides, brought
to a standstill by the gruelling pace, seemed to have
slipped out of the picture, leaving the centre of the
field to Dick and the Octopus, two gladiators at
ever-closer grips.
</p>

<p>
"Stick to him, Forge!" yelled Robin.  "He's
cracking up!  You'll be his 'daddy' yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Old Bess lets nobody be his daddy," indignantly
retorted Cuthy.  "Your captain's only a kid beside
him."
</p>

<p>
"Kid yourself!" snorted Robin.  "Just you watch
Forge, Cuthy&mdash;there'll be a hole in the back of this net
shortly."
</p>

<p>
Lyon alone on the Foxenby side gave useful aid to
his captain, and it was from two of the plodding
fullback's returns that Dick twice dodged Bessingham and
struck the cross-bar.
</p>

<p>
Both shots went where the keeper was not&mdash;each,
an inch lower, would have made a goal.  Such rough
luck notwithstanding, "Owd can't scoöar, owd can't
scoöar!" bawled Fluffy Jim, derisively waving his
papered arms.
</p>

<p>
"Some sort of mascot, this," thought the
bitterly-disappointed captain, "and to make sure I shan't miss
seeing him, they flatten him against the ropes.  Fun
for them&mdash;rotten for me!"
</p>

<p>
Time travelled apace.  The referee looked at his
watch&mdash;a plain hint that the end was nigh.  Nothing
seemed likelier than the match fizzling out in a goalless
draw&mdash;a depressing result, satisfactory to neither side.
</p>

<p>
Yet there was one among the spectators whose
youthful heart declined to be downcast.  One also
whose lungs were sound as a bell, and whose throat
was still capable of leading the way in a fresh chorus
of rousing yells.
</p>

<p>
Robin Arkness was the undaunted enthusiast who
started the swelling cheer which infected the neutral
spectators and struck a warm, reviving glow to Dick
Forge's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Well played, Forge&mdash;played the captain of the
Foxes!" yelled the Juniors, in uplifting chorus.  "Three
cheers for the good old captain&mdash;hip, hip, hooray!"
</p>

<p>
Ah, what priceless encouragement was this, at a
moment when all seemed lost!  To Dick it seemed to
bring new life, fresh strength.  He could feel his pulses
leaping again as the ball came his way once more.
Broome, too, felt the spur of that timely cheer, shook
off his ill-humour, and sprinted to the captain's side.
</p>

<p>
"Hang on, Forge!" he said.  "Go ahead!  Don't
bother passing just yet."
</p>

<p>
Bessingham, cool and confident as ever, bore down
upon the pair, feeling for the ball with feet that never
erred.  Clever, uncanny Bessingham!  Just how he
did it, you couldn't tell, but he nipped the leather right
from Dick's toe, and down went the mercury behind
the goal, changing the Cub-foxes' cheer to a groan.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, jumping crackers!" cried Robin.  "Forge has
lost it!"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I tell you?" shrieked the delighted Cuthy.
"The chap isn't born that can run round old Bess."
</p>

<p>
But this time it was not to be altogether a one-man
show.  Broome did not fail his captain.  The funk,
which had weakened his knees before, passed suddenly
away from him.  Brain-concussion was the risk he
lightly took as he jumped up to Bessingham's mighty
kick and headed the ball down again.  Jove, how it
hurt him!  For a moment it knocked him silly, but he
recovered himself sufficiently to dribble a few yards
and pass the ball to Dick.
</p>

<p>
Oh, glorious moment, sweet to have come to see!  At
last, at last, the Octopus was beaten&mdash;stranded in utter
helplessness.  His long legs, stride they never so widely,
could not overtake the flying Foxonian now.  His
colleagues had trusted implicitly to him to clear; only
one of them could get near enough to Forge to thrust
out a hacking foot, over which Dick nimbly jumped.
It was then a clear man-to-man encounter between
centre-forward and goalkeeper, with all the rest of the
players as idle spectators.
</p>

<p>
For the first time, in eighty-eight minutes of
strenuous football, the Octopus betrayed emotion and
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Come out to meet him, goalie!" he cried, in
desperation.
</p>

<p>
Out came "goalie" at the word of command, and
round him, with the ease of a dancing-master, waltzed
Dick.  Tears of real joy stung Dick's eyelids, for there
in front of him yawned the empty goal that nobody
could miss.  To make assurance doubly sure, he would
not even risk a gentle kick, but would, he told himself,
walk the ball into the net.  Oh, surely the Cup was
Foxenby's now!
</p>

<p>
And then, right across his path, almost beneath the
cross-bar, there came blundering an absurdly clumsy
figure in blue-and-white paper trappings&mdash;the grotesque
form of Fluffy Jim, the village idiot, who lunged
at the ball with a hobnailed boot and kicked it into the
net under the very eyes of the horrified captain.
</p>

<p>
"Theer!" cried Fluffy Jim, with a shriek of imbecile
laughter.  "Tha couldn't scoöar thesen, so Ah've
scoöared for thee!"
</p>

<p>
Poor Forge!  Unlucky captain of the luckless Foxes!
What miserable turn of events was this?  Why had so
farcical a thing come to mock him on the very verge
of his triumph?  A wild absurdity, yet an unspeakable
misfortune!  It made him feel dazed and stupid.  There
was a queer vagueness in the impression he got of an
excited crowd of spectators and players falling upon
Fluffy Jim and tearing to tatters his blue-and-white
costume.  He felt himself pulled hither and thither
by roughly-sympathizing hands, and with difficulty
wrenched himself free.  Then up strode the Octopus,
genuinely distressed and grimly resolute.
</p>

<p>
"Forge," said the Octopus, "the goal was yours and
the game is yours.  You will take the Cup."
</p>

<p>
"I can't," said Dick despairingly.  "I didn't score."
</p>

<p>
Bessingham turned abruptly to the referee.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," he said, "that was Forge's goal&mdash;this is
Foxenby's game.  Give them the verdict."
</p>

<p>
The referee was a big man, nearing middle age, who
had ruled exciting games before Bessingham was born.
He knew the laws of football from A to Z&mdash;had, indeed,
helped to make not a few of them.  And pleading with
him to alter those rules, even by a hairsbreadth, was
merely a way of wasting breath.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible," he said.  "I'm sorrier than I can
say, but Regulation 17 definitely rules that, if all or any
portion of the crowd encroaches on the ground during
the game, the tie shall be replayed in its entirety.  The
spectator broke in&mdash;that washes out the match."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, I beg of you," the Octopus pleaded.
"Restart the game here and now, and I'll see that
all comes right.  Foxenby's won, sir&mdash;be a sport!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a referee first&mdash;a sport afterwards," said the
whistle-blower, sharply.  "Time!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
A Rival to "The Foxonian"
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Roger Cayton tried in vain to pump the Juniors
about Fluffy Jim's luckless interference with the final
tie.
</p>

<p>
"Explain it?  Who could!  It just happened," said
Robin Arkness, the Fourth Form boy who had led the
cheering.  "You know how it is, Cayton&mdash;the wider
you open your mouth to shout the tighter your eyes
close.  I just yelled myself blind."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, now!  You had Clodhopper Jim bang
in the midst of you behind the goal.  Some of you must
have given him a final leg-up over the ropes."
</p>

<p>
"We didn't!" was Robin's indignant denial.
</p>

<p>
Roger thought he detected a shade of emphasis on
the "we".
</p>

<p>
"Who did, then?" he sharply inquired.
</p>

<p>
But Robin and his chums&mdash;known at Foxenby as
"Robin Hood and his Merry Men", because of their
escapades in the school shrubbery or "Forest"&mdash;were
not to be drawn.  Their ranks were recruited from both
houses, and it was an unwritten law amongst them that
nothing to the detriment of either house should ever be
spoken outside the select circle.
</p>

<p>
"We were awfully pipped about it, honour bright,
Cayton," said their frank-faced spokesman, evasively.
"Why, to be sure, aren't we just as proud as peacocks
to know that our rousing cheer bucked old Forge into
that great run?  And we didn't half 'lam' Fluffy Jim
for butting in and queering the pitch&mdash;eh, chaps,
what?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" the Merry Men chanted, in fervent
chorus.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cut away&mdash;skedaddle!" cried Roger, losing
patience.  "You're shielding somebody, and that's a
rotten thing for men of honour to do when Foxenby's
reputation is at stake."
</p>

<p>
Leaving this barb to rankle, as he knew it would, in
the hearts of the young adventurers, who prided
themselves on being loyal to the core, Roger returned to the
study which he and Dick Forge shared between them.
</p>

<p>
Dick was seated there, but did not raise his head,
being too deeply immersed in the latest issue of <i>The
Foxonian</i> to heed his chum's entry.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  That scurrilous rag out again?" said
Roger.  "Don't soil your hands, Dick; I'll reach the
tongs."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rats, Roger!  Don't be prejudiced.  It's
'extra special' this time," was Dick's enthusiastic
comment.  "Don't I just wish I could do anything
half so clever!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure you couldn't?  You generally
'click' when you make up your mind to tackle a thing,
Dick."
</p>

<p>
Dick flushed.  "Don't!" he said, quickly.  "Oh,
my dear old pard, have a care!  You are stirring
dangerously deep thoughts within me.  If I could
write with the sparkle and wit that Luke Harwood puts
into this topping magazine of his, I'd be content never
to kick a football or swing a cricket-bat again.  Listen
to this, lad&mdash;it's great!"
</p>

<p>
Appreciatively he read aloud a little article, in which
Luke Harwood had scourged some Foxonians whom
he had caught in the act of twisting an inoffensive
donkey's tail.  The irony was clever, though probably
aimed too high to penetrate the skulls of those whom it
was intended to shame.
</p>

<p>
"Literature, my good Roger," Dick declared.
"Shows a kind heart, too&mdash;he's down on animal-torturers."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right that he and everybody else should be.
Yet," said Roger rather bitterly, "in his laudable
anxiety to protect quadrupeds, he might have extended
a little consideration to donkeys of the two-legged
variety."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be sphinx-like, Roger!  When you look like
an owl and talk like a book I'm afraid of you.  What
are you getting at?"
</p>

<p>
"In plain English, then, this humane editor slates
the fatheaded youngsters who twisted the donkey's tail,
but omits to chide himself and his clique for pulling
the leg of Fluffy Jim, the village ass.  Now, honestly,
which do you call the crueller sport of the two?"
</p>

<p>
"You've turned on the searchlight, Roger, as you
always do, you clever beggar!  Why, to be sure, that
was a rotten business.  You told Harwood so."
</p>

<p>
"It was cruel all round, and hurt the school more
than it did Fluffy Jim.  Your big toe mayn't be right
for months, and what guarantee have we that we
shan't lose next term's replay by a couple of goals or
more?  The maddening part of the affair is that Fluffy
Jim couldn't have got to Walsbridge on his own.
Somebody paid his fare!"
</p>

<p>
Dick coughed uneasily.  Unsuspicious by nature,
believing good of everybody, he had already wiped from
his mind the mortification of his lost triumph.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Roger&mdash;no offence, old man, but aren't
you in some danger of exaggerating a thoughtless lark
into a deep-dyed melodramatic plot?  I'll convince you
that you are, dear boy.  Here's Harwood's own account
of the match&mdash;a top-notch piece of reporting, too.
Listen to the last paragraph.
</p>

<p>
"'It was heartrending,' he writes, 'to see this
Titanic struggle brought to an inconclusive finish, just
as the fruits of well-won victory were at our gallant
captain's lips.  No one can guess what motive was at
work in the village boy's mind when he scrambled in
to kick the ball from Forge's toes.  It is charitable to
assume his intentions were good&mdash;probably he thought
to win fadeless laurels for himself and Foxenby by
netting the winning goal.  Such intricate things as
football rules, involving the replay of interrupted
cup-ties, could have no meaning for him.  The whole thing
seems, at first blush, a disaster beyond compensation.
But are we not entitled to hope that good may yet come
out of evil&mdash;that even the great Octopus may be unable
to prevent us winning the replay by such a handsome
margin that none can dispute our supremacy?  Such a
wish, I am sure, is in the heart of every Fox who
witnessed that glorious and unforgettable game.'"
</p>

<p>
Roger stuck it through in silence, repressing an
impatient gesture.  Useless to "slate" Luke Harwood
while Dick Forge so manifestly credited the Foxonian
editor's loyalty.  The paragraph was engagingly
sincere in tone, and by his able control of the school
magazine "Old Wykeham's Pet Fox" always had the
last word.  So Roger gulped down his bile in an effort
to fall in with his chum's mood.
</p>

<p>
"He puts it well," said Roger, "and we can admire
his editorial skill without waiving our right to criticism.
I'm open to wager, for instance, that of twelve pages
this month he gives quite nine to the affairs of
Holbeck's House exclusively.  Am I right or not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quite right, Roger.  Rather natural, you
know&mdash;he eats and sleeps there."
</p>

<p>
"Getting one-eyed in the process.  Now, why
shouldn't Rooke's House be more in the picture?
We're a robust lot, even though we don't wear the
carpet threadbare on prize-giving days.  They produce
the most scholars; we turn out the athletes.  Honours
are evenly divided, but the Foxonian's space is not!"
</p>

<p>
"Granting all that, old spitfire, what remedy have we?"
</p>

<p>
"A rival paper," answered Roger, dramatically.
"Nay, but me no buts.  A rival magazine, sir, edited
by Richard Forge, and to bear the name of <i>Rooke's
Home Rag</i>.  All in favour, hands up.  Carried unanimously!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Roger, thumbs down!  Your project is
crazy; we could never run to it!"
</p>

<p>
"What!" thundered Roger.  "Shall it be said that
Dick Forge, Captain of Foxenby, fears to tread where
Luke Harwood has so long stalked alone?  You can
do it, old man, and you shall.  You owe it to yourself,
and to Rooke's House.  Mr. Editor, I salute you.  May
I have the honour of contributing something to the
first number of <i>Rooke's House Rag</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Dick thrilled with delight.  His chum's spontaneous
enthusiasm carried him along like a cork on the tide.
Always he had cherished in secret the hope of rivalling
the literary reputation which the school magazine had
won for Harwood; now, at last, his dream was to come
true.  Jottings from his pen, unsigned, but obviously
his, were to be printed, circulated throughout Foxenby,
discussed indoors and out, compared with Harwood's
work, and not necessarily to the captain's disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
His cheeks burned feverishly with the joyous
excitement of it all.  Football had small space in his
thoughts now; anybody could kick a ball about&mdash;that
was brawn, but writing was brain!  Enraptured by this
new bond of friendship, the pair discussed matters in
every detail, and before bedtime their plans were cut
and dried.
</p>

<p>
It was to be a fortnightly magazine, for which Dick,
whose aunt kept him well supplied with pocket-money,
was to be financially responsible; the subscription was
to be at the same rate as that fixed for <i>The Foxonian</i>,
and the number of pages were, in the aggregate, to be
the same also; but there all resemblance between the
two papers was to end.  Originality of method was to
be a strong point, imagination was to have full rein,
and the fortnightly publication would give sufficient
time for repartee if the honour of Rooke's House were
in any way assailed.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't sleep to-night, I know," said Dick, at
the end of their confab.  "Not even yet can I wholly
credit the thing.  Tell me, honestly, Roger&mdash;have
you the faintest doubt of its success?"
</p>

<p>
Roger slapped the captain's broad shoulders with
unusual zest and strength.
</p>

<p>
"No possible doubt whatever," he avowed.  "We're
heart and soul together in this venture, old boy, and
success is a certainty!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
What followed the First Number
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The manager of the Moston Fairtype Press made
no bones whatever about undertaking the publication
of <i>The Rooke's House Rag</i>.  Competition was healthy,
he said, and he believed there was plenty of room for
a second magazine in a big school like Foxenby,
"whose pupils," he declared, "were drawn almost
exclusively from the noblest and wealthiest classes."
</p>

<p>
Also, he continued, he welcomed the chance of
showing what his firm could do in trade rivalry with
Greatorex &amp; Co., who printed and published <i>The
Foxonian</i> for "Mr. Harwood".  A rough estimate of
the possible cost?  Certainly, if the young gentlemen
wished it, but it would be rather a waste of time, as,
from the standpoint of one who had the interests of
Foxenby at heart, he was prepared to cut the price as
low as it was possible to do it without actually losing
money on the job.
</p>

<p>
Deposit?  He wasn't at all concerned about that.
He could take it that Mr. Forge held himself personally
responsible for the cost of production?  That
would do, then; the word of honour of the Captain
of Foxenby was good enough for him, any day.
</p>

<p>
"Send your 'copy' along in due course, gentlemen,
and it shall have my personal attention from the
moment it enters our doors," he declared.  "I can't
say fairer than that, can I?"
</p>

<p>
The two boys, who had quite anticipated some hard
bargaining, were almost overwhelmed by this ready
support of their optimistic plans.  Their amazement
was so obviously reflected in their faces that the manager
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be alarmed, Mr. Forge&mdash;keep smilin',
Mr. Cayton," he said.  "I'm not givin' anythin' away!
Though nominally manager of this place, I am, in the
main, its proprietor, and I shall not lose in chargin'
you on the very lowest scale.  There is somethin' in
advertisement, you know."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-044"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-044.jpg" alt="&quot;DON'T BE ALARMED, MR. FORGE&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;DON'T BE ALARMED, MR. FORGE&quot;
</p>

<p>
Reassured, Dick took away with him the cash he
had come prepared to deposit, and both adjourned to
the nearest café to celebrate their good fortune in
finding so accommodating a publisher.  A happy
omen, surely, for the success of the new magazine!
</p>

<p>
All that week Dick, not without a twinge of
conscience, accepted help from Roger in his "prep." so
that they might both give more time to the arrangement
of the <i>Rag's</i> first number.  Outsiders had not yet
been invited to contribute; the first issue was to be
a surprise.  Every boy in the school was to receive
a free copy, in the confident hope that his subscription
would be forthcoming when he had digested the
mental food afforded by its contents.
</p>

<p>
It is the way of all amateurs to be over-sure at first.
</p>

<p>
A rude awakening awaited Dick and Roger.  Had
the Thames flowed past Foxenby on the morning of
publication, it would have run no risk of being set
afire.  Nimble youngsters aided in the distribution of
the copies, and by midday every boy in the school had
received <i>The Rooke's House Rag</i>.  There was, however,
no sign of anyone missing a meal to read it.
Some copies, alas, were flapping against the shrubbery
trees&mdash;cast adrift, as is often the fate of literature
circulated free.
</p>

<p>
Bravely pretending that their hearts were not
somewhere in the region of their boots, Dick and Roger
smiled at one another.
</p>

<p>
"Taken their breath away, I fancy, old chap,"
said Dick.  "Knocked them speechless.  Anyhow, the
silence is uncanny."
</p>

<p>
His comment was immediately followed by the
appearance of Luke Harwood, who came towards him
with outstretched hand.  With such a smile,
too&mdash;radiantly disarming!
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, Forge, old man!" he said.  "A
clinking idea, and a topping first number.  How
'squat' you kept it, too&mdash;quite a refreshing surprise."
</p>

<p>
Gripping Harwood's hand hard, Dick positively
blushed.
</p>

<p>
"You like it, Harwood?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!  It's hot stuff.  The real goods!"
</p>

<p>
"Awfully sporting of you to say so, Harwood, old
man.  You're the first to congratulate us.  I say 'us',
because Cayton's as much an editor of the <i>Rag</i> as I
am.  Decent of Harwood to give us such a send-off,
isn't it, Roger?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;to be sure!" agreed Roger, thinking
something altogether different.  (He would have
preferred laughing sarcastically in the Foxonian Editor's
bland face.)
</p>

<p>
"You've done it handsome, too&mdash;fine art paper,
and all that," said Harwood appreciatively.  "Always
coveted a similar 'get-up' myself.  Never had the
pluck to risk it, though.  Hope you'll get your
subscriptions in all right."
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me," Roger cut in, rather waspishly
"I'm cashier."
</p>

<p>
Harwood smilingly cleared off then, and nothing
further happened till afternoon school ended.  Then,
at Roger's suggestion, the co-editors entered the study
to talk matters over.  It was a warm autumn evening,
and a full moon kept the darkness at bay.  Consequently,
the yard was thronged with boys, and through
the study window, open at the top, it was possible at
last to hear <i>Rooke's House Rag</i> being discussed.
</p>

<p>
"Class one, I call it.  A reamer," declared a fresh
young voice, raised high, as if in challenge.  "Chews
the ears off <i>The Foxonian</i>&mdash;makes a grocer's sugar-bag
of it, by comparison."
</p>

<p>
Roger peered at Dick over his spectacles.  "Hear
that, my worthy editor?" he whispered.  "The
dulcet voice of Robin Arkness sings your praises.
Bravo, Robin!  Whatever lead he takes his 'Merry
Men' are bound to follow.  We've a doughty
champion there!"
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, a chorus of approval followed.  The
Rag was spiffing, top-hole, full of ginger, had the
Foxonian skinned a mile&mdash;of such a type were the
compliments that flew about for a time, making sweet
music for the co-editors' ears.  Then, as was perhaps
inevitable, came the jarring note.
</p>

<p>
"All rot, seems to me, bringing out another school
magazine," quoth a dissentient Junior.  "How many
of you chaps who are cracking it up have bothered to
read it?  Dull as ditchwater in my opinion, and half
a crown a term thrown away."
</p>

<p>
"That's the leader of the Fourth Form Opposition&mdash;young
Osbody from Holbeck's House," explained
Roger.  "Impossible to take his criticism seriously.
Matter of creed with him to oppose whatever Arkness
says.  Listen&mdash;all the 'Squirms' will back him up in
slating us."
</p>

<p>
The title of "The Squirms" had been invented by
Robin Arkness for the discomfiture of his rivals, and
was not, perhaps, unfair to them on the whole, as they
seemed to have the unhappy knack of drawing to their
side some of the least wholesome of Foxenby's Juniors.
Among the shortcomings of a few of them was a
disregard for the laws of hygiene&mdash;in other words, a
rooted dislike to soap and water.  In the matter of
personal cleanliness Foxenby's reputation stood high,
and the small minority who fell below the standard
were deservedly unpopular.
</p>

<p>
The "Squirms" justified Roger's inference by
shrilly attacking the <i>Rag</i>&mdash;not because they had
intelligent fault to find with it, but because they felt
compelled to dissent from "Robin Hood's" views in
any case.  Word-thrusts were given without mercy
and taken without flinching.  The Merry Men were
accused of becoming subscribers only to curry favour
with the captain; the Merry Men retaliated by
declaring that fear of Harwood's ash-stick prejudiced
the Squirms in the <i>Foxonian's</i> favour.  All these
verbal fireworks would have gone off harmlessly but
for the amazing conduct of one particular Squirm,
who, during a breath-taking lull, had the nerve to
speak well of the <i>Rag</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I say, all you chaps," he chimed in, "The <i>Foxonian's</i>
all right, of course, but you can't help
admitting that <i>Rooke's House Rag</i> is a jolly sight better
got up&mdash;first easily in quality of paper and style of
printing!"
</p>

<p>
What a set-back for the Squirms!  The Merry Men
uttered an ironical cheer at this falling away from the
enemy's ranks, and Osbody rounded furiously on his
weak-kneed supporter.  "Shut up, Mawdster, you
ass!" he cried.  "When you're asked for your opinion,
give it&mdash;not sooner, unless it's a split lip you're
seeking."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, Osbody," Robin intervened, in mock
terror, "don't split poor Mawdster's lip.  If you do
he might have to wash his india-rubber collar before
Christmas!"
</p>

<p>
Now, Osbody himself being always irreproachable
in tidiness, Robin well knew that this exaggerated
taunt would touch his rival's pride more than anything.
But even Robin was unprepared for the speed with
which Osbody leapt at him and hit him in the face.
A rough-and-tumble in the "Forest", well screened
by tall evergreens, was a safe amusement compared
with a free fight in the school-yard itself.
</p>

<p>
Keeping cool, Robin warded off Osbody's blows
without attempting to retaliate.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a loon, Osbody," he said.  "Wanting
to scrap here, right beneath the windows&mdash;it's a
madman's trick.  Come and settle it in the 'Forest'."
</p>

<p>
But feeling ran too high for compromise now.  The
swift attack on their chief had fired the blood of the
Merry Men.  Each selected an antagonist and went
for him, so that Dick and Roger, peeping cautiously
through the curtains, were the uncomfortable witnesses
of a pitched battle, of which their editorial venture was
the primary cause.
</p>

<p>
"This is an advertisement we didn't bargain for,
Roger," said Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Hang it, yes!  There'll be a miniature eruption of
Vesuvius if the Old Man hears of it.  Not another
prefect about, of course."
</p>

<p>
"We must run downstairs and nip it in the bud,
Roger."
</p>

<p>
"Most inconveniently for us.  Can't we lie 'doggo',
Dick?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, no.  It's up to us, old man.  I've winked
at these little Donnybrooks in the shrubbery, but
discipline goes overboard for 'keeps' if we let them
paint one another's eyes beneath our windows."
</p>

<p>
"Seems a pity to interfere when our side's getting
the best of it!"
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of the tempter, but Dick heeded it
not.
</p>

<p>
"Stay here, Roger.  No good both of us courting
unpopularity," said Dick, and Roger, ever a failure as
a disciplinarian, willingly remained behind.  Unseen
himself, he watched the captain hop between the
infuriated combatants.
</p>

<p>
"Ease off, you hooligans!" Forge said.  "This is
a school-yard, not a cockpit.  Boys of Rooke's House
will report to me at my study after tea.  The rest of
you will be reported to the head prefect of Holbeck's
House for&mdash;for" (he was about to say fighting, but
withdrew it in favour of a softer term) "unseemly
behaviour.  No back talk, now, any of you; clear!"
</p>

<p>
The Juniors scattered sulkily and formed up again
in opposite corners of the yard.  In the bright light of
the moon Dick watched them long enough to gather
that his interference had not been taken philosophically.
One Merry Man, of whose identity he was not certain,
took out a copy of the <i>Rag</i> and ostentatiously tore it
up.  It was whisked away by the warm wind to join
other spurned copies in the bushes.
</p>

<p>
Dick mounted the stairs slowly, sick with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"So much for our literary ambition, Roger, old
pard," he groaned.  "What sort of a kick-off do you
call this?  Couldn't be rottener, in my opinion."
</p>

<p>
And Roger, at a loss for words of consolation,
savagely knocked a dictionary off the table.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
Rhymes and Riddles
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The School Shrubbery was deserving of a better
name, for some of the trees were ripe in years, with
interwoven branches "that licked a freehand
drawing-book hollow", as Robin Arkness put it.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, to Robin and his Merry Men it was nothing
so common as "The Shrubbery".  They called it
"The Forest", wherein, on high days and holidays,
it was possible to have the most delightful adventures
that ever gladdened the heart of a romantic schoolboy.
</p>

<p>
Arkness himself had gradually gathered the band of
Juniors together, and his nimble wits were never at
a loss for entertainment.  His Merry Men voted the
sport he provided "real pie", knowing themselves to
be a source of envy to most of the Junior School.
</p>

<p>
A youngster needed to be sturdy and strong indeed
to be admitted to the select circle of comrades who
made the Forest their haunt.  Sometimes a whole
term went by without anyone qualifying for membership.
This was a very clannish band of brothers
indeed!
</p>

<p>
On an afternoon which was more like midwinter
than autumn, so shrewdly nipped the air, the Merry
Men collected fuel and lit a fire&mdash;not one big enough
to attract a prefect's attention, but still sufficiently cosy
to thaw the "cold ache" out of their fingers.
</p>

<p>
There was to be an open-air rehearsal for a
Christmas concert, followed by a play depicting "The
Merry Life of Robin Hood, the Outlaw of Sherwood
Forest".
</p>

<p>
"Now," quoth Robin, "those of ye who can sing
a cheery stave or two, pray join me in the opening
chorus.  It is called 'Hail, Merry Men', and goes to
the tune of 'Hail, Smiling Morn'."
</p>

<p>
"But we don't know the words, Robin," said Flenton.
</p>

<p>
Flenton was a tall, strong boy with a somewhat
melancholy face, lacking in humour but well-liked by
all.  As Robin's right-hand man, he was called "Little
John", and no boy amongst them could have looked
the part more convincingly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, thou knowest not the words, Little
John, for of a truth it was only yesterday I wrote them.
But thou shalt learn them ere long, for here is the
parchment on which is written, good and fair, the
ballade of which I speak.  List, my men, to the first
verse, which I will forthwith proceed to sing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Hail, Merry Men, ye Merry Men, ye Merry Men,<br />
  With arrows of grey-goose quill,<br />
  With arrows of grey-goose quill,<br />
  Whose trusty fingers shoot the stag at bay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stag at bay, stag at bay,<br />
  Whose trusty fingers shoot the stag, the stag&mdash;at her&mdash;ay!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Good!" said Little John.  "I like that.  It goes
with a swing."
</p>

<p>
"But we don't shoot stags, Robin," demurred Will
Ponder, known in Greenwood fashion as Will Scarlet.
"There aren't any round here.  Wouldn't rabbits be
better?"
</p>

<p>
"Rabbits, you fathead!  I mean, a murrain on thee
for thy stupidity," said Robin.  "How oft must I tell
thee that we are living now&mdash;or supposed to be
living&mdash;in the reign of good King Henry the Second, when
stags were plentiful and nobody kept rabbits&mdash;that is,
nobody wasted arrows on them?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind him, Robin," put in Dave Storm, who,
as a frequent student of Robin Hood lore, had insisted
on being called "David of Doncaster".  "Ponder's
mind runs on rabbits&mdash;he has some lop-eared bunnies
at home, and writes by almost every post to remind
the groom to feed them."
</p>

<p>
"Well now, no more daftness," said Robin.  "This
first verse has got to be learnt by heart before we can
tackle the second.  All together, boys:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Hail, Merry Men, ye Merry Men&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"No good!  You're flat, the lot of you.  What we
need is the schoolroom piano.  Any stout bowmen
willing to fetch it out?  Marry, speak not all at once!
Tinker, hast thou brought with thee thy sweet-stringed
lute?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got my mouth-organ, Robin," said he who
answered to the name of Tinker, while knowing
himself to be, on the school register, plain Tom
Jaye.
</p>

<p>
"Good for thee, Tinker.  And hast thou, Miller,
concealed within thy suit of Lincoln green, a mellow
flute?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm never without my tin-whistle, Robin,"
responded Alf Agers, pulling the instrument proudly
from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Then, my stout Merry Men, ye shall blow your
hardest on these instruments of torture&mdash;I mean on
the mellow flute and lute, while we troll our jovial
ditty under the greenwood tree."
</p>

<p>
Robin very much enjoyed talking in old English
fashion, and had secretly spent a lot of time in reading
up the correct phrases to use.  Often he would forget
himself and mix his old-fashioned speech with the
plainest of modern language, but it all came alike to
his loyal followers, who were, as a rule, too happy to
be critical.
</p>

<p>
Buoyed up by the strains of the mouth-organ and
the whistle, they made bolder onslaughts on the
opening chorus, warbling it more and more to its
author's liking each time.
</p>

<p>
"Now, good my men, the next verse, I beg of ye.
It runs thus wise:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Hail, Merry Men, ye Merry Men, ye Merry Men,<br />
  Who only rob the rich that they may help the poor,<br />
  Whose oaken cudgels crack the crowns of knaves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowns of knaves, crowns of knaves!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"That's O.K., Robin," said Little John, in honest
admiration.  "But why shouldn't it be 'crowns of
Squirms'?  They're the enemy, aren't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, my valiant John, dost want our first concert
to break up in a brawl?  Admission will be free to
esquires and friars, villains and knaves alike.  With
their usual cheek, some of the Squirms will wriggle
into the front seats.  Sing 'crack the crowns of
Squirms' and you'll have 'em at our throats in a
jiffy."
</p>

<p>
"We can look jolly hard at them as we sing it,
though," said Will Scarlet, "so they will know we
mean them by 'knaves'."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rather!" agreed Robin.  "Your deadly foes
will get some sound raps ere the concert is finished,
I promise ye, my Merry Men.  But never must we
give them cause to raid the platform.  There'll be
prefects present, and perhaps a master or two!"
</p>

<p>
Being too wise to weary them by endless repetition,
Robin dropped the chorus there and then, and passed
to the next item on the programme, which was a song
by "Allan a Dale", otherwise Frank Locke, the only
Merry Man who sang solos as a choirboy, though
always painfully shy about using his clear voice.
</p>

<p>
With nervous fingers he rustled the pages of the
ditty which Robin handed to him.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Robin, you ought to sing this yourself,"
he pleaded.  "It's mostly about you."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Allan, wouldst have the populace say that
Robin Hood loved nothing better than the blowing of
his own horn?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm all of a shiver," declared Allan a Dale.
</p>

<p>
"Tune up," said David of Doncaster, encouragingly.
"After all, Frank&mdash;I mean Allan&mdash;it's nice to have
somebody to practise on.  We shan't mind a bit,
whatever it's like."
</p>

<p>
"As you're all of a shiver, Allan a Dale," said Will
Scarlet, "I've thrown an armful of sticks on the fire.
Stand with your back to it, and chirrup."
</p>

<p>
Thus urged on, Locke sang a ballade extolling the
lighthearted way in which Robin Hood had cheated
sheriffs, cozened friars, beaten foes black and blue at
quarterstaff, outshot England's finest archers, and
generally proved himself the "star turn" in the
outdoor performances of his time.
</p>

<p>
Once rid of his nervousness Allan a Dale sang well&mdash;must
have acquitted himself excellently indeed, for
boys are not usually patient listeners to vocalism, and
none of them interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Right well wilt thou please the ears of them that
list to thee, my worthy Allan.  A brave sight shalt
thou be withal, clad in many colours, with a lovely
harp of gold and silver to twang as thou singest."
</p>

<p>
"A harp!" cried poor Allan.  "One of those things
with green cloth round it, which needs a handcart to
push it about?  Not for me, Robin!  I couldn't play
it."
</p>

<p>
"I've got an old mandoline," observed Dave of
Doncaster.  "I could teach Allan to pluck a few
notes out of that."
</p>

<p>
Robin shook his head vigorously.  "Wrong period,"
he said.  "Folk didn't sing Alabama coon songs in
those days.  Don't worry, Allan; we'll cut out the gold
and silver harp.  It would cost a term's pocket-money,
anyhow."
</p>

<p>
Came next a brisk bout of conundrums, riddles, and
rhymes, covering two foolscap sheets in Robin's small,
neat handwriting.  The novelty of these airy trifles
was that they had nothing to do with the sportive days
of Robin Hood.  They actually concerned Foxenby
School itself, being of a saucily personal character
which made the Merry Men first gape and then laugh
loudly.
</p>

<p>
"I shall ask you, David of Doncaster," said Robin,
"'Why should Rooke's House and Holbeck's House
always be able to work together?'  You will scratch
your head and look silly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Easy part," murmured Will Scarlet, in between.
</p>

<p>
"And then give it up," went on Robin, ignoring the
interruption.  "After that I shall say, 'You don't know
why Rooke's House and Holbeck's House should
always be able to work together?  Why, because
there's a Forge in one house, and a lot of bright sparks
in the other.'"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that," said Little John, rubbing his
chin.
</p>

<p>
He was the only one who didn't.  All the rest voted
it "ripping".
</p>

<p>
"But mayn't some Holbeckians think it rather a slur
on their house, Robin?"
</p>

<p>
"Out upon them for thin-skinned clowns if they do.
There are hits at both houses.  To you, Little John,
I shall put the conundrum&mdash;'Why do Rooke's scholars
need smoked glasses on prize distribution day?'  Gaze
at me in puzzled fashion, and I'll answer&mdash;'So's they
can Luke at Harwood when he dazzles them with his
brilliance'."
</p>

<p>
"Tophole!" was the general verdict.
</p>

<p>
"That's a smack at the other House which balances
things," said David of Doncaster.
</p>

<p>
"To me it seems rather a left-handed swipe," Will
Scarlet commented.  "Almost as if Luke Harwood
were swanking about with prizes under his arm, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"An it please him to put the cap on, let none say
him nay," quoth Robin.  "I will hie me to the next
item, which is a riddle in rhyme.  List, good my
men:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Forlornly I flap in the tormenting breeze,<br />
  Out at the elbows and out at the knees.<br />
  Never before such a figure of fun&mdash;<br />
  See how I make all the little ones run!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Why," said Little John, actually smiling, "anybody
knows the answer to that.  It's a scarecrow."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said a lot of the others.
</p>

<p>
"Wrong," said Robin.  "Keep it dark, all you
fellows, till the night of the concert.  The answer is
'Fluffy Jim'."
</p>

<p>
"The Village Idiot at the football match!" exclaimed
Will Scarlet.  "Best of the bunch, I call that.
Robin, old man, how in thunder did you make them
all up?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't!" said Robin.
</p>

<p>
"Then who did?"
</p>

<p>
"That's telling.  I'm not allowed to say."
</p>

<p>
"Whoever put them together was a clever guy."
</p>

<p>
"He <i>is</i>," agreed Robin, "but you'll never guess
who, so don't try.  There's twenty-two of them in
all and they ought to bring the house down.  But
now, my stout fellows," he broke off, changing again
to old-time terms, "right worthily have ye gone
through your parts, and I have a mind to reward ye
for it.  In yonder pack of mine there are sweet venison
pasties and sundry cakes, with three pottles of humming
ale&mdash;ginger ale.  If there be any amongst ye who
cares not to feast on such goodly fare, let him hang
himself on yonder tree for the crows to peck at."
</p>

<p>
Generous Robin!  Few, if any, of his Merry Men
guessed how short he went of every other luxury in
order to provide these tasty little feasts in the shade of
the Forest trees.  Other boys had hobbies&mdash;stamp-collecting,
photography, painting&mdash;but Robin had none.
For a hobby that needed pocket-money could not live
beside such hospitality as Robin gave to his Merry
Men.  He let them assume that most of the grub came
in hampers from home&mdash;some of it certainly did, but
for the greater proportion Robin quietly paid at the
Moston stores.
</p>

<p>
On logs tugged long ago to this particular spot, they
sat in a rough semi-circle round the fire, and fell to
with hearty good will.  Some supplemented the
viands from paper-bags held in reserve, and it seemed
a thousand pities that such a jovial little picnic was
doomed to be interrupted when the merriment was
at its height.  But interrupted it was, and in a manner
that was both startling and odious.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly&mdash;even more suddenly than showers come
in April&mdash;there splashed into the fire two jets of liquid,
followed immediately by another and yet another.
</p>

<p>
The fluid drenched the logs and sent up clouds of
pungent smoke, making their eyes smart and setting
them coughing and sneezing.  Simultaneously there
was the unmistakable clink of syringes against tin
pails, followed by smothered laughter and scampering
feet.
</p>

<p>
With angry cries the Merry Men jumped from their
logs and made away from the reeking fire.  The fumes
had a strong suggestion of acid from the laboratory,
making the vicinity of the fire an unhealthy place to
stay in.
</p>

<p>
"Those caddish Squirms!" yelled Robin.  "After
them, my Merry Men, after them!"
</p>

<p>
Yes, Robin&mdash;a long way after them!  Those quick-heeled
Squirms have made the most of their start, and,
run you never so fast in pursuit, you will not catch
them, not even be sharp enough to see the direction
they took.  They have vanished mysteriously and your
vengeance must wait until another day.
</p>

<p>
"Marry come up, but they shall pay for this!" cried
Robin, shaking his fist furiously into space.  "Ere
this week has gone by there shall not be a bone in the
bodies of the Squirms that shall not ache, and ache
again, from the cudgelling we shall give them.  Are ye
agreed on it, my Merry Men?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, Robin!" they cried, with deep and
passionate sincerity.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
The Plea of Peter Mawdster
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The complete failure of the first number of their
<i>Rooke's House Rag</i> gave Dick and Roger rather a
wretched night.  But with the morning-time there
came a ray of hope.
</p>

<p>
Luke Harwood brought in a whole sheaf of
subscriptions which he had voluntarily collected from
Holbeck's House.  There was a fine spirit of
sportsmanship about his unsought assistance, which almost
betrayed the grateful Captain into a display of emotion.
O'er Roger Cayton's head it heaped coals of fire indeed!
</p>

<p>
"'Pon my word, Harwood, you're real jannock,"
Dick managed to stammer.  "What hours you must
have spent on this collecting stunt!  It&mdash;it's
downright brickish of you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cut that out," said Harwood, with a laugh.
"To be honest, it was a jolly good excuse for dodging
'prep.'.  I didn't feel like swotting last night."
</p>

<p>
"But I say, you know, you shame me.  I never
thought of doing anything like this for you, Harwood!"
</p>

<p>
"The cases don't run on all fours, old man.  I took
over <i>The Foxonian</i> as a going concern.  Generations
of Foxonians had edited it before me.  It was almost
as old and venerable as Nelson's monument.  You
had competition to face&mdash;your <i>Rag</i> was an infant in
arms.  I love rivalry&mdash;it stimulates me.  Let nothing
discourage you, old boy&mdash;keep right on making each
number better than the last."
</p>

<p>
He faded away with his customary grace, leaving
behind him a completely captivated Dick and a
non-plussed and sour-visaged Roger.
</p>

<p>
"How now, Stormy Petrel!" cried Dick.  "It's
amusing to what extremes you carry your prejudice
against Luke Harwood, Roger.  Bears you no malice
whatever for the hard knocks you gave him in your
'Sauce for the Gander' column.  Now, Roger,
knuckle under, old man!  He's our Good Samaritan."
</p>

<p>
"Who appointed him our collector, anyway?" said
Roger.  "Sly impertinence, I call it.  Well," he added,
relenting at sight of Dick's crestfallen face, "perhaps
I am rather a graceless churl to-night.  I'll put this
bagful of money safely away in the locker, and then
start raking the subscriptions in myself before some
other voluntary helper queers my pitch!"
</p>

<p>
Harwood's "sly impertinence" had gingered Roger
up, at any rate.  By nightfall he had wheedled "subs"
out of the majority of Rooke's House, and when they
visited Moston with "copy" for the second number
of the <i>Rag</i>, they carried with them funds ample enough
to defray the cost of publication for months ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, do you mind holdin' over the matter
of payment a week or two?" said the Manager of the
Moston Fairtype Press, almost plaintively.  "I'm just
now neck-deep in arrears of work&mdash;never a spare
moment for book-keepin' do I get."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but we'd rather pay, really, and get it off our
minds," said Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Then we shall know exactly where we stand,"
Roger supplemented.
</p>

<p>
The manager spread out his ink-stained hands
imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Mr. Forge&mdash;carry on, Mr. Cayton.
I know you both&mdash;we can trust one another.  I'll
make out a bill to-morrow and you can pay me next
time you're in town.  I'd much rather!"
</p>

<p>
So the co-editors went away again with the money
in their pockets, excusably touched by this further
proof of confidence in their honesty.  Number two of
the <i>Rag</i> came out in all its glory, irreproachably printed
on fine-quality paper, and so far they hadn't been
permitted to pay a farthing towards its cost!  It
seemed almost like philanthropy.
</p>

<p>
It was gratifying, too, to see how much better the
second issue went down than the first had done.
Probably because they had paid for it this time, the
boys did not chuck it about, and it appeared to be
read with even closer attention than was the monthly
<i>Foxonian</i>, brought out simultaneously.  In truth, the
rival papers lashed out at each other, though with
perfect fairness, and the contents of both were voted
"particularly spicy".
</p>

<p>
"Roger, old man, shake!" cried Dick, after tea.
"This is my life's happiest day, I really think.  Thanks,
as much as anything, to your pungent 'Sauce for the
Gander', we are in this pleasant position&mdash;&mdash;  Now,
kid, why are you nosing about here?  Clear off!"
</p>

<p>
He broke into his congratulatory speech to turn
irritably on a flabby-faced, unhealthily fat youngster,
who had had the amazing cheek to draw his attention
by plucking at his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, Forge, I'd rather not go until I've
spoken to you privately," the Junior said.
</p>

<p>
"Privately!  Well, of all the nerve!  You can say
anything you've got to say in front of my friend here,
and look slippery, too.  Doubt if I ought to let you
speak at all&mdash;butting into our conversation like that."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Forge, but I don't think you'll mind when
I've told you everything.  I've come to you for
protection."
</p>

<p>
"Protection!  From me?  I'm honoured&mdash;overwhelmed!
Take a square look at this young genius,
Roger.  Is he quite 'all there', do you consider?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing balmy about me, Forge," said the
youngster, with self-possession.  "I merely called to
lay a complaint&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't lay it as heavily as a foundation-stone,"
interrupted Dick.  "That'll do for the first part of
your speech, youngster.  Hurry up with the second.
I'll give you a couple of minutes."
</p>

<p>
He took out his watch.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Mawdster, from Holbeck's House&mdash;the boy
who stuck up for the <i>Rooke's House Rag</i> when all my
chums were slating it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, to be sure!" said Roger.  "One of the
Squirms, and looks it, too."
</p>

<p>
The Junior gave Roger a quick glance which seemed
to say, "It's none of your business, anyhow."  Then
he made his moan.
</p>

<p>
"Ever since that day, Forge, I've caught it hot from
both sides&mdash;my own and Robin Hood's.  And all
because I said your mag. was better got-up than
<i>The Foxonian</i>."
</p>

<p>
Dick and Roger exchanged half-amused glances.
Then Dick looked back at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"One minute," he chuckled.  "Any more of this,
kid?"
</p>

<p>
"A lot, Forge!  They blackguard me all the
time&mdash;I've a dog's life between the two gangs&mdash;and
yesterday they held my head down ever so long in the
fountain."
</p>

<p>
"Did you report that to your prefect?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;to Harwood.  But he only laughed and said
it would save me the trouble of washing myself&mdash;or
some such rot.  I know why he did nothing&mdash;because
he'd heard I'd been running <i>The Foxonian</i> down and
praising your <i>Rag</i>, Forge.  He'll always have his knife
into me for that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rather!" said the Captain, ironically.  "Quite
a natural assumption that Harwood will lie awake o'
nights wondering how to get even with you.  Don't
be an idiot, young Mudster."
</p>

<p>
"Mawdster, if you please, Forge," the Junior
corrected, not too respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"Mawdster, then!  Don't snap!  I think I
understand you now.  You belong to Holbeck's House,
whose prefect snubs you.  Then, because you once
praised my magazine, you expect me to slip across and
break a stick over the backs of a score of youngsters
who are ragging you.  If there's a more brazen little
bounder in the whole of Foxenby, I've yet to hear of
him.  Quit!"
</p>

<p>
"But please, Forge&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quit, you little ass!" put in Roger.  "Don't you
know how hard the Captain can kick?"
</p>

<p>
The flabby youth, realizing that his audacious appeal
had failed, got quickly out of the range of Dick's boot.
But he paused long enough to get in a parting shot&mdash;a
stinger, too.
</p>

<p>
"After all," he said, "it's putrid to be bullied for
praising the <i>contents</i> of a magazine, when all you really
fancied was the paper and print!"
</p>

<p>
Both laughed ruefully at this when Mawdster had
vanished.
</p>

<p>
"That's a backhander for us, straight between the
eyes," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" Dick agreed.  "The oily maggot!  I
only wish I'd taken your tip, Roger, and driven my
uninjured foot into his fat carcase!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
The Squirms in the Forest
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On a dull Saturday afternoon Robin Arkness and
his Merry Men, rigged out for football, passed through
the school-yard.
</p>

<p>
Their voices were raised eagerly as they discussed,
in a friendly way, who should play on Robin's side and
who should form a team under the captaincy of Little
John.  Almost all they said was, therefore, audible to
Osbody and his Squirms, who, from the windows of
the dining-hall, contemptuously watched them depart.
</p>

<p>
"Silly asses, booting a ball about with only
themselves to score against," scoffed Grain, cracking a
walnut between his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Going by the fuss they make, you'd think it was
a match for the World's Championship," said Niblo,
a boy who never wasted pocket-money on regular
haircutting.
</p>

<p>
Practically every Squirm had some skittish comment
of this character to make.  As a body they hated
football.  Much more in their line was it to go marching
about the premises, annoying the servants and "ragging"
inoffensive youngsters.  In this way they
missed a lot of fresh Foxenby air, which would have
done them a world of good.
</p>

<p>
Osbody, leader of the Squirms, had outdoor
ambitions this afternoon, however.  The departure of
Robin and his Merry Men in the direction of the
football field had given him an idea.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," he said, "is there any reason why one gang
of Foxes, more than any other, should have the
Shrubbery all to itself?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit!"
</p>

<p>
"Confounded cheek on their part!"
</p>

<p>
"Old Man Wykeham ought to stop it!"
</p>

<p>
"Ours as much as theirs!"
</p>

<p>
"We're all in one mind about it," said Osbody.
"So, as Arkness and his band of bounders are off
leather-chasing, what's to prevent us having a bit of
sport ourselves under the greenwood tree?"
</p>

<p>
With one accord they tumbled to the notion.  Such
a jolly sight less "fag" to walk right into the Shrubbery
without the painful necessity of fighting their way
through its outskirts&mdash;a plan of campaign which, with
disastrous results, they had twice tried before, on each
occasion retiring as a routed and damaged rabble.
</p>

<p>
Singing and shouting and skitting, they slouched
in straggling array to the Shrubbery.  That morning
gardeners had been busy lopping the tree branches,
many of which were strewn on the ground.  Some
were green and damp, but others crackled crisply
when trodden on.
</p>

<p>
"They'd burn like&mdash;like blazes," said Grain, not
very brilliantly.  "What say you, chaps, to lighting a
fire where they've had theirs?"
</p>

<p>
"That'll be clinking," agreed Osbody.  "Not on
the spot they last used, though.  I guess our squirts
made that wet for the winter.  A ripping score to make
off them, wasn't it, boys?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" said Niblo, gleefully.  "Some of them
were coughing and rubbing their eyes all next day."
</p>

<p>
"True.  Mr. Rooke looked in and asked if any
of them wanted cough mixture, but they didn't
bite!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!  Buzz round, boys, and rake up the fuel.
If I can't beat Robin Arkness at fire-making, I'll chew
my boot-protectors for a week!"
</p>

<p>
Bold words.  But there are days when fires simply
will not burn as they should.  Match after match was
struck and thrust vainly into the newspapers which
formed the foundation of the pile.  Some black smoke
rose in a languid way, but again and again a fitful
breeze blew out the tiny flame.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody must be breathing hard," said Osbody,
trying to hide his vexation beneath a show of humour.
"Get round, boys, and fan it with your caps."
</p>

<p>
"Funny thing, this bad luck," Grain remarked.
"When Arkness lights a fire it blazes up like billy-o
inside half a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Grain, skit," growled Osbody.  "'Spose
you think of me as Guy Fawkes, unable to set the
fireworks going?  Come and have a whack at it yourself,
then, Mr. Clever!"
</p>

<p>
Grain swaggered nearer.  "Don't mind if I do,"
he said.  "Couldn't very well make a worse boggle
of it, could I?"
</p>

<p>
He knelt beside the fire and drew from his overcoat
pocket a brown-paper parcel, through which grease
was oozing slightly.  This was a bad investment in
ham sandwiches, which Grain (almost always eating)
had found far too fat for his liking.
</p>

<p>
Without opening the package, he scooped a hole for
it amongst the newspapers and dry twigs, covered it
with spreading boughs, and restarted the fire.  It
crackled, spluttered, and burst into a blaze, flinging
off an unpleasant odour of rancid fat.
</p>

<p>
Still, as a warming spectacle its success was
immediate.  Grain had scored over Osbody, the established
leader of the Squirms, and made but a poor effort to
conceal his satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Smart!" sneered Osbody.  "Since when did you
start out hawking lard and dripping, Grain?"
</p>

<p>
This was the sort of bickering which was always
going on between the two leading spirits of the Squirms.
You never get a pleasant atmosphere where fellows
are always trying to score off one another.
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was a waspish interchange of
sarcastic remarks all round.  Then Niblo, less peevish
than the rest, started them off round the fire in a mock
Indian war-dance, which warmed their blood and put
them in a better temper.
</p>

<p>
"Rather a jolly stunt, Niblo, old boy," said Osbody.
"Gives me a rattling good idea for a new band&mdash;one
that should chew the ears off Robin Hood and his
Merry Men."
</p>

<p>
"Out with it, 'Body, my bantam," Niblo said.
</p>

<p>
"It's this&mdash;why shouldn't we all be Wild West
cowboys, with Buffalo Bill as the head of the
band?"
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Hurrah!" cried some of the Squirms.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it would be tophole," went on Osbody,
flushing with excitement.  "We'd have such fun as
never was.  I'd be Buffalo Bill&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" Grain dryly commented.
</p>

<p>
"And we'd go on the trail and hunt buffaloes and
scalp Red Indians, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, do all those
topping things you see 'em perform at the picture-shows.
Now, boys, all in favour of a Buffalo Bill band, hands
up!"
</p>

<p>
Shouts of approval signified an almost unanimous
consent.
</p>

<p>
"Then squat round the fire, my cowboys, and we'll
talk over the details," said Osbody.
</p>

<p>
"Fire's too low," Grain said.  "Gone down while
we were doing the tomahawk crawl.  Wants something
on it to make a rattling good flare.  What price the
fibre-matting which is chucking about over yonder?
Jove, it wouldn't half burn."
</p>

<p>
"So would our ears when the masters had finished
clouting them," Osbody observed.  "Matting doesn't
grow on trees.  The gardeners have left it there."
</p>

<p>
"Shows they've no use for it, then," Grain
persisted.  "Come on, boys, bring it to the fire."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," Osbody said.  "It's there for a purpose.
Covering up saplings from the frost, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Covering up fiddlesticks!" scoffed Grain.  "They've
chucked it there to get rid of it.  Christmas, won't
it blaze!  Who'll join me in fetching it?"
</p>

<p>
"It means a furious swishing for whoever does,"
was Osbody's warning.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, 'Body, old man, you're afraid!" Grain
jeered.
</p>

<p>
The taunt reddened Osbody's cheeks still more,
but he had the courage to stick to his guns.
</p>

<p>
"Rotto!" he exclaimed.  "I like a lark, but this is
sheer fatheadedness.  Don't we get hidings enough
without seeking them?"
</p>

<p>
"Who'll get a hiding?" argued Grain.  "Not us,
if anybody.  Every master and prefect in Foxenby
knows who prowls round this shrubbery.  Supposing
the matting is missed, then who'll 'click' the blame
for it?"
</p>

<p>
"Robin Hood and his Merry Men," said Niblo.
"I see your drift, Grain."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Osbody, be a man," Grain urged.  "You
can see there's no risk.  Robin's 'put it across you'
more than once lately.  What a fine chance of getting
your own back!"
</p>

<p>
Osbody hesitated.  His sporting instincts were not
altogether dead.  In better company he would have
realized that Grain's proposal savoured of a dirty trick.
But he lived always in hopes of "doing down" Robin
Arkness, whose successful rivalry had lately thrown
him very much in the shade.  Temptation assailed
him strongly: he wavered and fell!
</p>

<p>
"In for a lamb, in for a sheep, chaps," he said.
"Come along!  We'll fire the matting."
</p>

<p>
Without giving his conscience any further time to
prick, he darted across to the huge sheets of
fibre-matting, clutched one, and dragged it towards him.
</p>

<p>
Then up before his astonished sight there sprang
suddenly a bunch of sturdy young figures in football
costumes, while from under other similar coverlets
emerged the remainder of Robin Hood's Merry Men,
with challenging cries that struck terror to the hearts
of the dumbfounded Squirms.
</p>

<p>
"Caught!" cried Robin, leaping straight at Osbody.
"Have at them, my Merry Men."
</p>

<p>
"You rotten sneaks, skulking about in there after
pretending to start for footer," cried Osbody, in mortified
fury.  "Stand your ground, chaps, and slug 'em!"
</p>

<p>
He certainly set them a gallant example.  Whatever
his failings, funk was not one of them, and he gave
Robin measure for measure in a rough-and-tumble
encounter, more like a wrestling-match than a bout of
fisticuffs.
</p>

<p>
Old enemies amongst the rest picked each other out
and came to grips, but not more than half of the Squirms
faced the music.  The remainder ran from the sudden
appearance of the Merry Men as they would have
galloped from ghosts, and their judgment was good,
for those of their gang whom they left behind were in
for a sorry time indeed.
</p>

<p>
A dozen of them were collared and held captive
almost at the first attempt.  "I yield, I yield!" they
cried, in craven chorus.
</p>

<p>
Not that they lacked reason for giving in so soon on
this occasion, because the flight of the majority left
them hopelessly outnumbered.
</p>

<p>
Their arms were pinned behind them, and they were
unceremoniously bustled out of the way of the very
much severer bouts which were taking place between
Robin and Osbody, and between Grain and Little
John.  Osbody and Grain had far more "ginger"
in their natures than any of the other Squirms, and
the Merry Men gave them every chance to fight it out,
confident that Robin and Little John would sooner or
later prove themselves the victors.
</p>

<p>
Twigs snapped sharply beneath the combatants'
feet as they pushed one another to and fro in determined
efforts to bring about a fall.  But with Arkness
and Flenton there rested all the moral advantage that
comes of fighting in the presence of friends, and slowly
but surely the tide of battle turned in their favour.
</p>

<p>
"You've got him this time, Robin!" somebody
shouted.  "His back's bending; he'll be down in a
second."
</p>

<p>
Osbody made a last gallant effort to prove that this
prophecy was all wrong, and managed to spin out the
struggle half a minute longer.  Then over he went
with Robin on top of him, and almost simultaneously
Little John succeeded in putting Grain flat on his back.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cried the Merry Men, rushing to the
spot to relieve Robin and Little John of the custody
of the vanquished Squirms.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, that was a tough job," Robin panted.
Then, remembering the part it was his delight to play,
he continued:
</p>

<p>
"Chins up, foemen, for I would have speech with
ye.  Little did ye guess, when ye talked of burning
the matting and letting the blame fall on me and my
Merry Men, that beneath it I and they lay snugly
hidden, ready to pounce out upon ye, and drub ye
soundly for such villainous behaviour."
</p>

<p>
"Villain yourself!" snapped Osbody.  "Who pretended
to go footballing, and sneaked round here instead?
You and your dirty dogs of Men!"
</p>

<p>
"Bandy not such words with me, caitiff, or it shall
go hard with thee and thy crawling Squirms.  Fair
as the day was the trick we played on ye&mdash;a stratagem
to draw ye to the Forest, whither ye would have been
too chicken-hearted to venture had ye thought to meet
us there.  Yet ye and Grain have fought a good fight
to-day, and I am minded to treat ye well."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any of your favours," said Osbody,
sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"I will give thee the chance, nevertheless," said
Robin.  "Tell me the names of those who put out
our fire with garden-syringes, and all but choked us
into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"Shan't!" said Osbody.
</p>

<p>
"Thou flatly refuseth, then, to hand the miscreants
over to justice?"
</p>

<p>
"What miscreants?  What justice?"
</p>

<p>
"A murrain on thee for thy saucy back-talk!  There
will be more trouble than thou wottest of if thou dost
not speedily humble thy pride."
</p>

<p>
Osbody could see that Robin was in a mighty passion
at the recollection of the quenched fire, and the heart
of the leader of the Squirms sank within him.  He
was just about to make a clean breast of it when,
glancing at Grain, he saw that youth looking at him
with contemptuous eyes, as much as to say: "I know
you're going to blab to save your precious skin."  For
it was Grain who had planned and carried out the
squirting scheme, besides insisting on mixing
chemicals with the fluid, a notion which Osbody had
condemned as dangerous.
</p>

<p>
Grain's sneering gaze stiffened Osbody's back.
</p>

<p>
"You can save your breath, Arkness," he said.
"You know as much about it as you ever will."
</p>

<p>
"All right, you chump!" answered Robin, dropping
back into modern speech.  "If you will ask for it, you
shall have it, and not only you, but every one of your
gang that we've got trussed up to-day, innocent and
guilty alike.  Boys, bring the master Squirm to the old
bonfire."
</p>

<p>
Laughing in gleeful anticipation of what was to
come, the two Merry Men who held Osbody fast
dragged him, kicking and struggling, to the ashes of
the bonfire which the Squirms had previously
extinguished with squirts.  Beside this Robin knelt,
scooping up a generous handful of black ashes.
</p>

<p>
With a quick inkling of what was coming, Osbody
redoubled his efforts to get free.  Finding himself
too well held, he panted:
</p>

<p>
"Here, what's the game?  None of your dirty
tricks on me, now!"
</p>

<p>
"You sing loudly," said Robin, "so I'll make a nigger
minstrel of you.  Hold him tight, my Merry Men!"
</p>

<p>
Thereupon he rubbed upon Osbody's neck and face
the whole handful of bonfire ash, smelling pungently
as it did of mingled wood and acid.
</p>

<p>
Osbody yelled furiously at first, but was compelled
to close his mouth to prevent his tongue being coated
with the ash.  Very soon his grey eyes shone comically
out of a coal-black face, and the ludicrous sight
he presented made the Merry Men laugh so much
that they were in some danger of releasing their
captives.
</p>

<p>
"You filthy brutes, you shall suffer for this," Osbody
howled, with difficulty suppressing tears of mortification.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-078"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-078.jpg" alt="&quot;YOU FILTHY BRUTES, YOU SHALL SUFFER FOR THIS&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;YOU FILTHY BRUTES, YOU SHALL SUFFER FOR THIS&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Why, knave, what ailest thee?  Art thou not being
adorned by the lovely chemical dye which thee and
thy henchmen made?  I have changed thy mealy
countenance into a glossy black one, and yet thou
slingest abuse at me.  A plague on thee for thy
ingratitude!"
</p>

<p>
"He looks just like a shoe-polish advertisement!"
gurgled Will Scarlet, between his paroxysms of mirth.
</p>

<p>
"I'll knock the face off you, when I get at you,
Ponder!" stormed Osbody.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to wash your own better than usual
first," Ponder smartly retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Six paces to the rear with him," commanded
Robin.  "Prithee, Grain, if thou mindest not my
chaff, step forward to receive thy new complexion."
</p>

<p>
Grain did no stepping forward&mdash;he was forcibly
propelled by merciless knees from behind.  Ash there
was in plenty, and Robin did not stint it.  In generous
measure he smeared it all over Grain's features, being
quick enough to save his fingers from the snapping
teeth which viciously strove to bite them.
</p>

<p>
"Now there are two little nigger boys," said Robin,
giving a final deft touch to Grain's chin.  "Bring along
another eight Squirms, and then there'll be ten."
</p>

<p>
What aching ribs the Merry Men acquired as the
wriggling Squirms, one after another, had their faces
well blackened by the charcoal of the fire!  No revenge
could have been more deliciously sweet.  In vain
did the wailing victims threaten to inform their
respective housemasters if the performance did not cease.
There was not a Merry Man who believed that they
would dare to peach, nor, for the matter of that, was
there one who would not have taken a swishing in
preference to missing a lark such as this.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Robin, "every mother's son of you
would make an excellent Man Friday to Robinson
Crusoe."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they'd rather think of themselves as the
cannibals of Monkey Island," David of Doncaster
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Whichever they like," said Robin.  "Oh, I can't
laugh any longer&mdash;I'm positively weak with it!  Rush
them to the Forest edge, Merry Men, and give them
a flying send-off.  Good-bye, you gentlemen of
colour!"
</p>

<p>
Knowing themselves to be fearful figures of fun, the
limp and groaning Squirms allowed their rivals to push
them out of the shrubbery and send them flying into
the school-yard.  Not even Osbody and Grain had any
fighting spirit left.  Holding their caps over their
faces to hide themselves as best they could, they made
a bee-line for the kitchens, where soap and hot water
would be plentiful.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what a scream!" cried Will Scarlet.  "I believe
I've cracked a rib with laughing.  They'll never forget
this as long as they live!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure that we haven't done them rather
a good turn than a bad one," said Robin.  "They <i>will</i>
have to wash themselves to-day, if never before!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
The Burglary
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A storm of extreme violence swept across Foxenby
one night.  It was like a gigantic oratorio of
wind-music, with the sea's roar as an accompaniment.
</p>

<p>
The dormitories faced west, and therefore missed
the worst of the gale, though some of the boys lost
sleep through it.  Dick and Roger were among the
sufferers from insomnia, and got up before daybreak
by mutual consent, meaning to make themselves a cup
of coffee in their study.
</p>

<p>
"Jove, listen to the windows rattling!" cried Dick.
"And how blinking draughty it is!  Why, there's
snow on the table!"
</p>

<p>
"No wonder," Roger said.  "Here's a pane of
glass blown clean out, just as if it had been cut by a
glazier's diamond.  We shall have to do the 'Mary
Ann' business this morning.  Bring the mop, Dick, old
son."
</p>

<p>
"Plus a sheet of brown paper as a dummy window-pane,
what?  I say, Roger, flash your electric torch
into this corner&mdash;it's as dark as Erebus.  Things seem
topsy-turvy, too.  I've cut my hand against a broken
teacup already."
</p>

<p>
Roger's torch pierced the gloom, and the chaos it
disclosed brought a cry of dismay from Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my hat!" he exclaimed.  "There's been
dirty work here to-night, and it's not all the wind's
doing, either.  Have a squint, Roger!"
</p>

<p>
"Burglars!" cried Roger.  "They've burst open
the locker, and it's any odds our money's gone.
Investigate, Dick, quick!"
</p>

<p>
No investigation needed!  The thieves had made
a good job of it!
</p>

<p>
"Not even left a luck-penny behind them!" groaned
Dick.  "Roger, old man, we're 'broke'.  The hounds
have cleaned us out!"
</p>

<p>
"Our savings gone, and every cent of the <i>Rag's</i>
subscription money, likewise!  Oh, confound that
printing-works' manager&mdash;why the dickens couldn't
he have taken the 'dibs' when we offered to pay?
It&mdash;it's stark tragedy, Dick!"
</p>

<p>
He sank into a chair with his head in his hands,
apparently overwhelmed.  Dick, always more
practical, hastened to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Crying mops up no spilt milk, old boy," he said.
"The police must know of this.  I'll knock up
Mr. Rooke, and get him to telephone down."
</p>

<p>
Roger's teeth were chattering, but he followed Dick
to the housemaster's quarters, and helped him to
pommel the bedroom door.  Mr. Rooke grumbled
sleepily at this unceremonious alarum.  He had been
awake half the night, and he eyed the boys with sour
disapproval until they had explained matters.  Then
he became gravely alert.
</p>

<p>
"Show me the damage," he said.  Having seen it,
he flew back with long strides to a room next his own
and examined a cabinet there.  It had been wrenched
open and its contents extracted.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," he gasped, "that's the Headmaster's coin
and pewter cupboard, and they've stripped it bare.
Coins of the Roman era, with some almost invaluable
old silver and pewter besides.  He had them insured
for some hundreds of pounds, but money can't replace
them.  Hello, there!"  He was at the telephone now.
"This is Foxenby School; get me the Moston
police-station, please&mdash;I don't know its number.  Quick as
you possibly can&mdash;there's been a burglary."
</p>

<p>
At his command Dick and Roger hurried off to
awaken the Head and the other masters, some of whom
speedily discovered that they, too, had been robbed
in a greater or lesser degree.  But all their troubles
paled before the Old Man's loss.  He had thought
his treasure-cabinet burglar-proof, and his usually stern
face now seemed almost boyishly distressed.  He was
writing a book about his unique collection, and the
recovery of the treasure was essential to the
manuscript's completion.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for everybody who has been robbed,"
he said, "and devoutly hope we may recover the stolen
goods.  You boys have lost nothing, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
Roger was beginning to explain that they had,
indeed, lost a very great deal, but the prompt arrival
of a police-inspector silenced him.
</p>

<p>
"Our men are already out scouring the district,"
the inspector briskly reported.  "The burglars may
not have escaped.  Awfully sorry this has occurred,
sir; must have slipped in between the beats.  Can I
see the rifled rooms, please?"
</p>

<p>
His tour was so thorough that Mr. Rooke and the
boys lost patience, and begged the Head to let them join
in the search for the thieves.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, go," the Old Man agreed, "but be wary.
Burglars are usually armed.  Don't jeopardize your
skins by indiscreet valour."
</p>

<p>
It proved altogether an unprofitable adventure.  The
wind on the heath stung their faces with icy points
of hail, and over that wide expanse of moorland a
regiment of hidden men could have escaped detection.
But it was quite unlikely that the burglars had remained
in the district.  They had the choice of several roads
leading inland, and were probably miles away by
now.
</p>

<p>
Fagged out and wet to the skin, the trio gave it up
towards lunch-time, hoping that the police had had
better luck.  But they hadn't, nor had any of the
hardier schoolboys who had taken up the quest.
</p>

<p>
It looked like a cleverly pre-arranged piece of
cracksmanship, and few of those despoiled entertained much
hope of seeing their property again.  The local police
were up against a big thing, which oppressed and
baffled them.
</p>

<p>
The inspector took away a few photographs, together
with an index of the Head's stolen valuables.  Dick
and Roger could give him no workable details of their
loss.
</p>

<p>
"It was all in silver and notes, and we hadn't taken
the numbers," Roger explained.
</p>

<p>
The inspector shrugged his shoulders.  "Sorry,
young gentlemen, but recovering cash is like getting
butter out of a dog's throat.  I've made a note of the
totals, and we'll do our utmost, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we quite understand, thank you, inspector,"
said Dick.  "It's 'good-bye for ever, good-bye', to
quote Tosti's song.  Hope you'll have luck with the
Head's stuff, anyhow&mdash;that's far more important.
He's fearfully cut up about it."
</p>

<p>
The two chums walked off together in silence.  Both
feared to voice the dread that was in their minds, and
it was a relief to come across Hadwin, the school
librarian and sports' secretary, who was pinning three
announcements on the hall notice-board.
</p>

<p>
Hadwin was a quiet boy, exceedingly tactful always,
and he left them at once, saying as he went:
</p>

<p>
"There's something there which will interest you
chaps, I think.  We're all awfully sorry to hear of
what happened last night.  Mr. Rooke told us you'd
lost everything.  Hard lines!"
</p>

<p>
Not too pleased that everybody knew, they thanked
the librarian, and turned to read what he had fastened
on the board.
</p>

<p>
One paper announced that, owing to the urgency
of commencing structural alterations within the School,
the Christmas holidays would begin a week earlier
than usual.
</p>

<p>
"Good biz!" commented Roger.  "That should
save us publishing a Christmas Number, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
Another paper asked that boys who had seen or heard
anything suspicious on the previous night would at
once communicate with the Headmaster, so that the
police might be given every possible clue.
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' doin' there," said Dick.  "It all happened
away from the dormitories, worse luck.  They
knew their way to the Golden West all right!"
</p>

<p>
The third announcement quickened their interest
somewhat.  It referred to the County Schools' "Final",
and set forth that "the Committee had carefully
considered the unfortunate incident which terminated
the final tie at Walsbridge, and, while appreciating the
sportsmanship of St. Cuthbert's written request that
the Cup should be awarded to Foxenby, were unable
to do otherwise, in face of Regulation 17, than order
the match to be replayed in its entirety.  The re-play
would take place on the Walsbridge F.C. ground,
before Easter, on a date to be mutually arranged."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's sticking to the strict letter of the law,
in all conscience," commented Roger.  "St. Cuthbert's,
like good sports, give us the Cup, but the Committee won't."
</p>

<p>
"I agree with them, Roger&mdash;they're right!"
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
"Honest, old boy!  A goal's a goal when the ball's
in the net&mdash;not before.  Fluffy Jim put it there; I
didn't."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come off it, Dick!  You would have done."
</p>

<p>
"I should, almost certainly.  But there's the very
outside chance that I might have slipped on the
goal-line, and lost the ball.  Funnier things have happened,
especially in exciting cup-ties.  Therefore, the
Committee's ruling is fair."
</p>

<p>
Roger's eyes shone with appreciation of his chum's
absolute impartiality.
</p>

<p>
"Righto!" he agreed.  "You and the Octopus are
a pair!  Anyhow, it'll be great to see such another
football duel as that was."
</p>

<p>
"I wish the re-play were to-day, Roger," said Dick,
earnestly.  "It would take my mind off the&mdash;the other
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed.  We're both of us trying, with poor
success, not to look as miserable as we feel."
</p>

<p>
"I shall get a special 'exeat' to-morrow, Roger, and
go down to tell that printer chap how things are."
</p>

<p>
"Quite the soundest policy, dear old chum.  I
heartily approve.  Here, let's go to the Common-room
and have a bit of music.  Nero fiddled while
Rome was burning&mdash;we'll bang the piano and trust to
luck, too.  Are you game, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
His begone-dull-care manner, so unusual with Roger,
lifted Dick up responsively.
</p>

<p>
"Cheerio!" he cried.  "Lead the dance, Sir Roger
de Coverley!"

CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
Luke Harwood in the Picture
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
British weather is notorious for its very quick changes.
Thus, the day after the fruitless burglar hunt, the
Captain of Foxenby was sitting in warm sunshine on
the verge of the Shrubbery when the Prefect of
Holbeck's House strolled across to condole with him.
</p>

<p>
"At the risk of seeming to rub it in, Forge, I want
to tender my sincere sympathy," said Harwood, sitting
beside him.  "In your shoes I'd be puzzled what to do."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks&mdash;yes.  I'm pretty well bunkered, Harwood.
Unconsciously, by your kindness in collecting
all those subs., you did us a bad turn; they all went."
</p>

<p>
"And by now, doubtless, have been spent on a
fuddle in the Thieves' Kitchen," Harwood agreed.
"More of my mistaken zeal coming back on me!  The
money's gone&mdash;Kismet!  No subscriptions, no paper!"
</p>

<p>
The captain turned sharply round to stare at the
Prefect.  "What do you mean, Harwood?  'No
paper!'  Are you thinking, then, that there'll be no
<i>Rooke's House Rag</i> after this?"
</p>

<p>
Luke gave his pleasant laugh.  "Well, it's rather
a natural inference, Forge.  Paper costs money.
Printing-ink ditto.  If the money's in the Thieves' Kitchen
it can't be spent here.  Ergo, you are justified in
ceasing publication."
</p>

<p>
He felt annoyed during this speech to find himself
getting somewhat red in the face beneath the questioning
scrutiny of Dick's clear eyes.  There was something
about what he had said which evidently did not
appeal to the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Harwood, please don't suggest a get-out
that I'm sure you wouldn't adopt yourself!  Take the
Foxes' money and give them nothing in return!
Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"But you didn't take the brass&mdash;the burglars pinched
it.  Don't be too straitlaced, Forge, for your own sake.
Men of business 'wind up' when their funds are
stolen, and nobody blames them.  It's simply Fate!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks for the tip, Harwood!  Perhaps I am
over-squeamish, but I took a quarter's subscription
from Foxenby in exchange for a fortnightly mag.,
and I mean, by hook or by crook, to deliver the goods."
</p>

<p>
Harwood jumped up and shot out his hand impulsively.
There seemed to be a troublesome lump in
his throat as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, old fellow!  You're top-hole.  Keep the
flag flying by all means, and if there's anything I can
do to help; any&mdash;er&mdash;little loan&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by Jove, no thanks, Harwood!  Awfully
decent of you, but this is entirely my own show."
</p>

<p>
Contrary to his custom, Harwood did not efface
himself this time.  He resumed his seat beside Dick
and talked in quiet tones of other things, apparently
oblivious of a growing disturbance in the shrubbery
behind him&mdash;a row which closely concerned him, too,
because the Juniors of his House were foremost in
making it.
</p>

<p>
It was not now the old squabble between Merry Men
and Squirms, to which the Prefects, by common consent,
turned a deaf ear.  On this occasion the Squirms
had it all to themselves.  They were "ragging"
somebody, and the shrieks of their victim were agonized
enough to suggest a lynching.
</p>

<p>
"Are your youngsters killing a pig this morning,
Harwood?" the Captain inquired, uneasily.  "Rather
more din than usual, what?  Shouldn't like the Old
Man to hear it in his present raw state."
</p>

<p>
Harwood looked languidly round at the heaving mass
in the shrubbery.  "It'll die down," he said.  "Like
Bo-peep's lost sheep, they're better left alone.  Let me
see, what was I saying?  Oh, about that Cup re-play,
old man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He got no further, for at that moment the dishevelled
victim of the Squirms' horseplay burst from the
shrubbery and fastened his dirty hands frantically on the
Prefect's knees.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Harwood, please, they're murdering
me&mdash;murdering me, I say.  Send them back&mdash;take their
sticks from them.  I'm beaten black and blue!"
</p>

<p>
The boy's fat, unwholesome cheeks shook like those
of an overfed man.  His small eyes protruded with fear.
Though bearing no visible sign of ill-usage, he looked
the picture of abject terror.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, Mawdster&mdash;take your filthy paws off my
breeks!" Harwood commanded, in disgust.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but aren't you going to do anything for me,
Harwood?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I'm going to cane some of the dirt off your
hands if you aren't inside Holbeck's within half a
minute," said Harwood, inexorably.
</p>

<p>
This was an order which few Juniors would have
dared to disobey, but the trembling boy, after a nervous
glance back at the Squirms (discreetly silent now),
stretched out an imploring hand to the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, Forge, won't you protect me?" he
whined.  "Harwood never will.  He doesn't care if
they kill me!"
</p>

<p>
Here, indeed, was rank rebellion&mdash;open defiance of
a prefect, and insult heaped upon it.  For the second
time, Peter Mawdster had committed the gross offence
of appealing to the Captain of the School over the head
of his own prefect.
</p>

<p>
Dick said nothing at all.  With a nod to Harwood,
he rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"Hop into my study at once, Mawdster," said
Harwood furiously.  "As you're determined to seek
trouble, you shall have it&mdash;six on each hand."
</p>

<p>
This incident&mdash;trivial perhaps in itself&mdash;left an
unpleasant impression on Dick's mind.  That a cheeky
youngster from another House should twice have tried
to secure his protection was irritating enough, but
Harwood's method of handling the shrubbery trouble did
not strike him as possessing the wisdom of Solomon.
Whatever Mawdster had done to deserve his unpopularity,
in bullying him so badly the Squirms had earned
punishment.  Yet the Prefect of Holbeck's House,
without inquiry, caned the victim and let the
tormentors go free!
</p>

<p>
"Is that bias or just an error of judgment?" Dick
asked of Roger, to whom he confided the details of the
occasion.
</p>

<p>
"I'd better not voice an opinion, Dick!  Where Luke
Harwood is concerned, possibly I'm one-eyed, too!"
</p>

<p>
"But wouldn't you, in my place, have interfered?"
</p>

<p>
"Emphatically, no.  If anybody in Holbeck's House
has a grievance against its prefect, he can report it to
Mr. Holbeck.  There is a further Court of Appeal&mdash;to
the Headmaster himself."
</p>

<p>
"Well put, Roger, K.C.!  You have freed my mind.
I want nothing more on it than is already there, I can
assure you."
</p>

<p>
He was about to tell Roger what Harwood had
said about ceasing the publication of the <i>Rag</i>, but a
second thought stopped his tongue.  He did not
himself question the sincerity of Harwood's suggestion,
but he felt instinctively that Roger would.  He feared
that Roger, always prejudiced against <i>The Foxonian's</i>
editor, would say that the wish was father to the
thought&mdash;that the early death of <i>The Rooke's House
Rag</i>, leaving <i>The Foxonian</i> once more alone in the
field, would just suit Harwood's book.  So he changed
the subject for another.
</p>

<p>
"I've got my <i>exeat</i>, Roger, and shall cycle to Moston
to see the Fairtype Press manager this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Good luck!" said Roger.  "Hope he'll be decent
about it."
</p>

<p>
Head scholar of Rooke's House though he was,
neck-and-neck rival of Luke Harwood in the race for the
Christmas prizes, Roger made mistakes that afternoon
which caused amused astonishment in class.  Work
could not hold him.  His thoughts were elsewhere.
Heart and mind he was with Dick Forge in the Moston
printing-office, wherein much that affected their
reputation at Foxenby was in the balance to-day.
</p>

<p>
What if that fair-spoken printing manager declined
to wait for his money, or, worse still, refused to print
off another number of the Rag?  Luke Harwood had
already announced a "special term-end number" of
<i>The Foxonian</i>&mdash;how humiliating it would be if no
<i>Rag</i> appeared as a counter-blast to it!
</p>

<p>
Yet, if such a downfall threatened them, Roger was
powerless to avert it.  His people were in poor
circumstances; only by dint of winning scholarships could
Roger keep himself at Foxenby.  The small burden
of his scanty savings had been lifted from him by the
burglars, and Dick had been relieved of far more.  No
wonder Roger had no appetite for tea that night!  His
eyes were pools of troubled light as he raised them to
greet Dick on the latter's return.
</p>

<p>
"Come, dear old fiddle-face, cheer up!" laughed
Dick.  "All's well!"
</p>

<p>
"Dick, I can see the good news oozing out of you.
Bravo&mdash;you've worked the oracle!"
</p>

<p>
"Easily!" said Dick.  "That printer's heart must
be all aswim with the milk of human kindness.  It
seems he'd read about the burglary in the newspaper,
which was obviously hard up for 'copy', because it
mentioned us by name as co-editors of the <i>Rag</i>, and
made far more sympathetic fuss over our loss than it
did over the Head's.  Well, Mr. Printer put out his
hand, said how sorry he was and all that, and told me
to lose no sleep&mdash;he'd do his bit in the publication
department if I cared to carry on."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what a brick!  Who'd have thought it from
the looks of him?  At first I considered him rather
soapily insincere."
</p>

<p>
"You're a funny old ox, Roger&mdash;always suspicious
of everybody!"
</p>

<p>
"Except of you, old sport," Roger replied.  "Didn't
he want a guarantee of some sort?"
</p>

<p>
"None whatever.  Accepted without demur my
promise to pay up in full next term.  Made me blush
half-way down my back by saying he could see I was
the soul of honour.  And I can manage it quite O.K. by
the exercise of strict economy.  It means mortgaging
a year's allowance at least, and docking every kind
of luxury, but who cares for that if the dear old <i>Rag</i>
goes on?"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody&mdash;three cheers!" cried Roger.  "Out with
the ink and paper, you jolly old editor chap!  I'm going
to present your next number with a burlesque of the
burglary, just to show the school how lightly we carry
misfortune!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
The Merry Men give an Entertainment
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The big room in which the speech-days and
prize-distributions were held was always open to any of the
Foxes who fancied themselves as entertainers.  Many
odd concert-parties had aired their graces there,
sometimes to full "houses" at the commencement and
empty chairs before the end.
</p>

<p>
Always brimful of confidence in himself, Robin
Arkness had never a doubt that his variety-show would
eclipse every entertainment previously staged at
Foxenby.
</p>

<p>
With bland assurance he issued special invitations
to all the masters, not excepting Old Man Wykeham
himself, and made every preparation for a record
"house", firmly believing that only those Foxes who
were temporarily in hospital would be absent on this
great occasion.
</p>

<p>
"My main fear is that there won't be seats for all,"
he confided to his Merry Men, an hour before the
commencement.  "Some of you chaps had better slip
into the corridor and arrange the first comers into a
queue, as the policemen do outside the theatres.  We
don't want a pancake scramble when the doors are
opened."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bob out and see how they're rolling up," said
David of Doncaster.
</p>

<p>
"'Rolling up' is hardly the right term," he reported,
when he came back.  "There isn't a soul about."
</p>

<p>
"What!" shouted Robin, disbelieving his ears.
</p>

<p>
"You could shoot a cannon-ball down the corridor
without fear of hitting anybody," Dave declared.
</p>

<p>
"Rot, Dave!  You're an owl&mdash;you're a bat&mdash;no,
you're neither, for you can't see in the dark, you
chump.  The corridor ought to be packed like a
sardine-tin."
</p>

<p>
"Ought to be, perhaps, but isn't.  Go and see for
yourself, Robin."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't matter&mdash;haven't time," said Robin, with
dignity.  "Don't talk so much, Dave, but freeze on
to the other end of this table.  Help me to turn it
upside down.  We don't want any of those beastly
Squirms dancing a cellar-flap on it during the
performance."
</p>

<p>
This was no high-class concert hall, where the
performers strode elegantly in by the side-door at
starting-time.  There was hard work for each perspiring
member of the troupe.
</p>

<p>
Chairs had to be collected from all parts of the
school, oil-lamps had to be filled and lighted (for at
moorland Foxenby there was no such luxury as electric
light or gas), and the big palms had to be carried from
the conservatory to give the stage a classical
appearance.  Then, to complicate matters, Tom Jaye, known
as the "Tinker", misplaced the music which had been
entrusted to him as accompanist on the school piano.
</p>

<p>
"Think, you chump; where did you have the stuff
last?" Will Scarlet demanded impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"If I knew that, idiot, couldn't I go straight to it
without asking anybody?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you've been making a fire with it to warm
your nose," commented David of Doncaster.
</p>

<p>
The Tinker had a little nose like a scarlet button,
and this personal remark did not serve to sweeten him.
</p>

<p>
"Play your own silly old music," he remarked.  "I
shan't!"
</p>

<p>
"You mean you can't, having torn it up for a
paper-chase or something."
</p>

<p>
"Stop barging, you chaps," said Robin, "and
hustle round to find the missing sheets.  It'll be time
to start shortly."
</p>

<p>
He split them up into search-parties, and with frantic
haste they explored every nook and cranny of the
building.  Useless!  At the time fixed for the opening
of the door nothing of the missing music had been seen
by anybody.
</p>

<p>
"Tinker, they knew something about you when
they called you Jaye," Robin panted, half-ironically,
half-despairingly.  "You're not only a Jaye but a
cuckoo as well.  There's no help for it.  You and
Miller will have to do duty on the mouth-organ and
the whistle."
</p>

<p>
The Tinker grabbed nervously at his inside pocket.
Then he looked wildly around at the Merry Men.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he gasped.  "I wonder where my
mouth-organ is?  Somebody must have pinched it.
It's a Squirmish trick!"
</p>

<p>
"You're the silliest ass ever, Tinker.  Have another
look, man, quick!  <i>That's</i> the pocket it ought to be
in."
</p>

<p>
Robin slapped the pocket indicated and drew from
the Tinker's chest a crackling sound.
</p>

<p>
"What's that you've got across your chest, Tinker?"
he asked.  "A sheet of tin?"
</p>

<p>
Then over the Tinker's features there spread a smile
that was sickly to look upon.
</p>

<p>
"Golly, I remember now," he said.  "Mother
always warned me to beware of catching cold.  I felt
shivery after to-day's rehearsal and stuffed the music
under my vest to keep my chest warm.  Here it is!"
</p>

<p>
They called him anything but pet names as he
shamefacedly produced the music, but their chief
feeling was one of amused relief.  It could hardly have
been expected that the audience would have taken
seriously ballads sung to the strains of a tin-whistle.
</p>

<p>
"All of you get behind the curtain for the opening
chorus," Robin commanded, "while I throw the doors
open and admit the surging crowd."
</p>

<p>
To his surprise and disappointment, however, the
crowd did no surging.  It entered casually in twos and
threes, and showed an almost unanimous desire to
occupy the chairs farthest away from the stage.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of room in front!" Robin called out.
</p>

<p>
"All serene!" somebody answered.  "Don't care to
be too near, thanks: rather afraid of earache."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," said another wag, "some faces, seen
close, are a strain."
</p>

<p>
"Heard say that the opening chorus is a rattling
good imitation of a cat-fight in the shrubbery,"
remarked a third boy.  "That's why I came early."
</p>

<p>
Observations such as these, from an audience far
scantier than he had expected, would have depressed
any other stage-manager than Robin.  But nothing, it
seemed, could quench the sunshine in the heart of the
Merry Men's leader.
</p>

<p>
"If, after the show, any of you gentlemen are
dissatisfied, you shall have back whatever money you paid
at the door," he told them, airily.
</p>

<p>
Ten seconds later he was on the stage, with the
curtain up and the performance in full swing.
</p>

<p>
"Hail, ye Merry Men" was not, perhaps, an
operatic number, yet it had plenty of "kick" in it and
was sung to a tune everybody knew.  Moreover,
through it all there rang the rich alto of Allan a Dale,
whose voice would have redeemed any chorus from
the commonplace.  It bore down the derisive laughter
of the critics in the audience, and won from some of
the quieter ones a fair round of hand-clapping.
</p>

<p>
Sung with an enthusiasm that carried it to almost
every part of the school, it served also as an
advertisement, reminding the boys that something was afoot.
Chessmen were bundled into boxes, darts were left
sticking in boards, and there was a fairly general exodus
from the play-room to the play-house.  Robin,
peeping through the side-curtains during Allan a Dale's
solo (which, unluckily, was somewhat marred by the
tramping of feet), observed with pride that the Captain
of Foxenby had entered with the Prefect of Rooke's
House, closely followed by Luke Harwood, Broome,
and other Sixth Form boys of both houses.
</p>

<p>
All chose seats as far back as they could get, but most
of them were in time to applaud Allan a Dale, who,
under less disturbing conditions, would doubtless have
taken an encore.
</p>

<p>
"I'll nip down the steps and lock the door, before
we start the riddles," said Robin.  "Otherwise the
clumping of feet will spoil the fun."
</p>

<p>
How heartily he wished, a moment later, that this
thought had occurred to him earlier!  Before he could
put it into execution the Squirms entered in a body,
saw the empty seats, and noisily took possession of
them.  Then, chattering like rooks in a tree, they
settled down to watch, if not to listen.
</p>

<p>
"Just what I most feared," said Little John, moodily.
"Now we shall have them gaping at us like stuffed fish
all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Don't get stage-fright about it, chaps," Robin
urged.  "They'll not dare to fly at us while the Captain
and both prefects are here.  Fancy they're off the
earth!"
</p>

<p>
Signs of impatience on the other side of the curtain
caused him to bustle his Merry Men on to the stage for
the next item.  Just as he had hoped and believed, the
riddles took the fancy of the mixed audience.  Forge's
jolly laugh was early noticeable; Harwood clapped
heartily and several times called out "Good!"  Even
solemn old Lyon chuckled now and then, and only
Roger Cayton kept a fairly straight face.
</p>

<p>
"Can't think why you don't laugh, Roger, old man,"
Dick said.  "Funny as a circus, I call it."
</p>

<p>
"They're comical kids, right enough," Roger admitted.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking more of the riddles than of them.
All-round leg-pullers!  Flashes of real wit, and so
topical.  That riddle about Fluffy Jim, for
instance&mdash;would you have guessed it?  I shouldn't in a blue
moon."
</p>

<p>
"They've got the audience tickled, anyhow,"
commented Roger.
</p>

<p>
Said Harwood behind them, in dulcet tones:
"Wonderful stuff for such young 'uns to put together,
eh, Forge?  We must look to our laurels!"
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly," Forge agreed.  "It's first-class
skitting, free from any malice.  Let's give them a jolly
good cheer at the finish."
</p>

<p>
"Beware of distending their skulls," Roger grunted.
"Junior 'swelled-head' is a troublesome disease."
</p>

<p>
They brushed aside his warning laughingly, and led
the applause when the last saucy conundrum had been
asked and answered.  It was then observed, for the
first time, that both housemasters were standing by
the door, laughing and clapping as heartily as anyone.
Even if nothing else happened to-night, Robin's
concert was already an assured success.
</p>

<p>
Songs and recitations of a mirthful kind rounded up
the first part of the programme, the Merry Men making
up in enthusiasm for what they lacked in vocal talent.
The Squirms, however jealous they might be, had perforce
to squat there as quietly as sheep in a field.  They
could only show their pent-up feelings by wriggling
uneasily and yawning frequently.
</p>

<p>
The ten minutes' interval gave them the opportunity
of escaping had they been so minded.  Instead, they
clung to their seats and ate oranges, apples, and nuts,
saving the shells of the nuts in the hope of using them
as missiles later on, perhaps, when the masters and the
prefects had departed.
</p>

<p>
"Quick work and no waiting" was Robin's stage
motto.  Well inside the ten minutes he had the curtain
up again, displaying to view a very creditable imitation
of Sherwood Forest, painted on canvas by some of his
more artistic Merry Men.
</p>

<p>
For the words of his play he depended on a two-penny
book, selected because of its cheapness, so that
every performer could, when learning his part, thumb
a copy of his own if he chose.
</p>

<p>
There was a good deal of "knave and varlet" about
the dialogue, but actions speak louder than words, and
some very fine bouts of quarter-staff, varied by vigorous
wrestling exhibitions, provided so much amusement
that the melodramatic nature of the words was easily
overlooked.
</p>

<p>
The cudgels were made of cardboard, warranted to
give nobody a headache, which was lucky, for in the
course of fifteen minutes Robin had six bouts with
sundry adventurers, felling them all to earth in turn.
</p>

<p>
It was a part which suited him to perfection, and
none of his Merry Men grudged him the largest share
of the limelight, for he had worked far harder than any
of them to ensure the success of the play.  There were
no pauses in the ding-dong little performance, which
looked like proceeding to a triumphant conclusion when
a startling incident occurred.
</p>

<p>
It happened almost immediately after the two
house-masters, the Captain, and the prefects had quietly left
the room to attend a meeting.
</p>

<p>
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were hammering
merrily at each other with stout wooden swords, when
one of the oil-lamps above them was suddenly put out
of action by a direct hit from an apple.
</p>

<p>
Intent on the performance, none of the Merry Men
on or off the stage noticed who hurled the apple, but
everybody saw the flare as the burning oil ran swiftly
along the stage and ignited the flimsy scenery.
</p>

<p>
"Sherwood Forest" was in a blaze immediately, and
there were all the makings of a stampeding fire-panic
if prompt action were not taken.
</p>

<p>
"Down with the curtain!" cried Robin.  "Rush to
the front, Dave, and tell them to keep calm.  Say
we've got it under&mdash;we shall have in half a tick.  Little
John, fetch the fire-extinguisher beside the back door."
</p>

<p>
Without thinking of the risk he ran of singeing the
hair off his head, he dragged some of the canvas away
from the running fire, and then tried to beat out the
flames with his sword.  His cool, quick example inspired
others, who tore away anything that might have become
involved in the fire.  Little John's return with the
fire-extinguisher settled matters.  When the contents of
that had been sprayed upon the blaze, nothing but
smoke and smell remained of what might have been a
very serious conflagration.
</p>

<p>
"That's a part of the performance that wasn't in the
bill," said Robin.  "Jove, how my heart thumps!  I
really thought we should all be burnt alive!  What
started it, chaps?  I wasn't looking."
</p>

<p>
"<i>This</i> started it," said Little John, picking up a hard
russet apple, which had rolled into a corner.  "Some
bounder in front chucked it at the lamp."
</p>

<p>
"Or possibly at me," Robin said, "and hit the lamp
instead.  Don't let's make more than a silly trick of it,
or the masters may hear about it, and there'll be such
a row as never was.  The show's over for to-night,
anyhow.  What a thundering mess to clear up!"
</p>

<p>
"Beastly shame we should have it to do," grumbled
Will Scarlet.  "It's pretty certain one of the Squirms
threw the apple.  Why not bring them in to swab the
deck?"
</p>

<p>
"Good idea!" agreed Robin.  "We could threaten
to tell the prefects if they didn't."
</p>

<p>
Just then Dave came back, vastly relieved to find the
fire out, for he had been too briskly occupied in front
to give a hand in quenching it.
</p>

<p>
"Those cowardly Squirms would have rushed out
like rabbits if I hadn't shamed them into leaving
quietly.  They've all cleared off, but some of the other
chaps are waiting about to see if you need any help."
</p>

<p>
"Tell them they can hop it, Dave; everything's
safe," said Robin.  "Ask 'em to keep their mouths
shut, though, to avoid any fuss.  Later on, we'll find
out who threw that apple and settle the score!"
</p>

CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
Settling the Score
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Russet apples are not everyone's fancy.  They need
to be well-ripened before they are palatable, and most
boys prefer a larger, juicier kind.
</p>

<p>
Which of the Squirms had bought russet apples on
the day of the Robin Hood concert?  Apples too green
for him to eat with relish, seeing that he had thought
fit to waste one by throwing it on the stage.  Therein
lay the clue to the particular Squirm who had caused
the fire, cheated the performers of their well-earned
applause, and left the majority of them with scorched
costumes and slightly-burnt fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever the little bounder is, it isn't right that
he should get off scot-free," said Robin, a few days
after the trouble.
</p>

<p>
"But how are you going to discover him?  Osbody's
an oyster.  He wouldn't tell who squirted acid on the
bonfire, even when you were blackening his face with
the ashes."
</p>

<p>
"True, Dave: he's no blabmouth.  Best of the
bunch, by far.  Shan't ask him who threw the
apple&mdash;we'll find it out ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Take a bit of doing," Little John observed.
</p>

<p>
"Chance for the amateur detectives amongst you,"
Robin answered.  "What are the Squirms doing all
day long?  Stuffing themselves.  Even gorging under
cover of their desk-lids.  Watch 'em.  See what they
eat.  If any one more than another grinds up russet
apples, he's our man."
</p>

<p>
The plan seemed delightfully simple.  Anybody
might be a Scotland Yard 'tec with such a straight-forward
clue to work on.  Every Merry Man became
a sleuth from that moment.  After meals, when it was
the custom of the school to throng into the common
room for fifteen minutes or so before restarting work,
they watched the Squirms out of the corners of their
eyes, noting with what kind of apple each of them
supplemented his diet.  The cores of several varieties
of both eating and cooking apples, and even those of
sour crab apples, were picked clean and cast into the
fire, but never once was a Squirm detected in the act
of eating a russet.
</p>

<p>
"No good," declared Robin; "it's 'nix', as the
Yankees say.  The chap who flung the russet is too
'fly' to go on eating that kind.  We must try another
way.  Let us fare forth, Little John, old son, to ye
olde village tuck-shop.  I would have speech with the
stout dame that selleth prog therein."
</p>

<p>
The proprietress of the little village tuck-shop was
waxing fat on the proceeds of what she sold to the
hungry Foxes.  She received Robin and Little John
with an expansive smile, her hand going mechanically
to the tin containing Robin's favourite biscuits.  Robin
chatted pleasantly as she weighed out his customary
purchase.
</p>

<p>
Politely offering her a biscuit before passing the bag
to Little John, Robin said:
</p>

<p>
"Mother, I heard our matron talking about you the
other day.  She said she'd give her ears, or something
like that, for a complexion as nice as yours."
</p>

<p>
"Did she now?  Not really?  Ah, well, I expect
she does feel it, poor dear, with her so pale and
thin&mdash;almost green as you might say&mdash;and my cheeks
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Apples," Robin promptly put in.  "Perhaps you
eat a lot of apples, Mrs. Roe, to keep your cheeks
rosy."
</p>

<p>
"Never touch 'em, Master Robin.  Can't ever get
sufficient to keep you Foxenby boys going, let alone
myself."
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to have any to-day, Mrs. Roe?"
</p>

<p>
The proprietress pointed to some empty baskets.
</p>

<p>
"Them was half-full an hour ago," she declared, "but
a dozen or more young gentlemen came in and took
the lot."
</p>

<p>
"Hard lines!  I particularly wanted some apples.
Haven't you a few russets left?"
</p>

<p>
"Given up stocking them, Master Robin.  No
demand.  Sold the last pound to one of your young
friends a few days ago.  He was about the only one
who ever bought any, and catering for one person alone
doesn't pay."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, Mrs. Roe.  Still, I did so fancy a
russet apple to-day.  I wonder if the chap who bought
'em will have one or two left?  Just possible, isn't it,
Flenton?  Could you describe him to me, Mother?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a bit short-sighted, lovey, without much
memory for faces.  He's a biggish boy, about your
age, but stouter.  If he were my son, I'd see that he
kept himself cleaner and smarter."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, perhaps he was born with a sallow
skin, Mother.  Can't you describe him a little better
than that?  What name did the other fellows give
him?"
</p>

<p>
"There, you're asking me something!  I've such a
poor memory for names.  Let me see, what did they
call him?  Barley&mdash;no; Wheat&mdash;no; bless me,
something like that, but not quite."
</p>

<p>
"Was it Grain, Mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Grain, that's it!  I thought I couldn't be far out."
</p>

<p>
"Have another biscuit, Mother.  No?  Then
Little John will, won't you, old chap?  You're quite
sure Grain was the boy who bought the russet apples,
Mother?  I do so fancy a juicy russet!"
</p>

<p>
"They weren't what you might call juicy, lovey&mdash;rather
green, I should say.  Master Grain certainly
bought all I had left.  He might just have one by him
still."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mother&mdash;I'll speak to him about it.
Good-day."
</p>

<p>
He took Little John's arm and walked quietly from
the shop, crunching a gingerbread between his firm,
white teeth.  Outside, he slapped Flenton gleefully
on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Flenton, old kid, we've got this apple mystery
whipped to a froth," he cried.  "Grain it is who
knocked over the lamp with his russet apple, and Grain
it will be who'll go through the hoop for it."
</p>

<p>
"Seems as plain as a pikestaff," Little John agreed.
"But how shall we catch Grain alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave it to me.  I'll think out a scheme.  We'll
make the beggar sorry he upset our applecart with his
russet, never fear!"
</p>

<p>
All unconscious of the rod in pickle for him, Grain
went about his blustering way, pinching and prodding
the luckless nippers who chanced across his path,
forcing his fellow Squirms into episodes they would
fain have funked, and generally making himself openly
feared and secretly hated.  The only way to "buy him
off" was with food and sweetmeats, he being so greedily
fond of both that he seemed, like some animals, to be
always chewing.
</p>

<p>
One half-holiday, passing through an empty class-room,
he saw by the other door a paper-bag, through
a slit in which a biscuit peeped.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he muttered.  "Some clumsy idiot's
dropped a bagful of fodder."  Picking it up he opened
the bag.  "Half-a-pound of mixed biscuits, mostly
chocolate ones!  Whew!  What a find!  Nobody
about.  Impossible to know who owns them.  Might
be any one of the four hundred kids in Foxenby.
Grain, old son, you've stumbled on a good thing."
</p>

<p>
Glancing quickly round to make sure he was unobserved,
he turned his back on the door and popped
a chocolate biscuit into his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Scrumptious!" he murmured.  "Any more little
waifs and strays in want of a good home?  A dozen of
you?  Walk right in!"
</p>

<p>
His hand was in the bag again, when the sound of a
soft footfall behind him caused him to swing round
nervously.  Then all the toothsome biscuits went
crashing to the floor as he found himself engulfed by a
resistless wave of Merry Men, who, led by Robin,
spread themselves round him and half-smothered him
in their tight embraces.
</p>

<p>
"Another beastly trap, you cowardly cads!" he
cried.  "Let go of me, or I'll half kill somebody!"
</p>

<p>
Considering that he was as firmly trussed up as a
turkey at Yuletide, this threat was empty and
vainglorious.  His immediate captors numbered half a
dozen, and there were so many more in reserve that a
strong man might have despaired of breaking away.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, you greedy food-sneak," said Robin.
"You're our prisoner, and you're going out to the
Forest.  There you will be tried as a robber and a
knave.  Bring him along, my Merry Men."
</p>

<p>
"I'll yell the house down," Grain declared.
</p>

<p>
"Not you!  Little John, throw thy muffler round
his mouth if the varlet maketh the slightest sound.
Across the yard with him, lads; there's no time to
waste."
</p>

<p>
Vigorously they pushed Grain out of the house, and
as unceremoniously propelled him across the yard
towards the Shrubbery.  Half-way there the captive
caught sight of Roger Cayton, who was walking about
with his hands behind his back&mdash;the Prefect's
characteristic attitude.  Nobody else was about, and
Grain, terrified now of what was in front of him,
chanced a yell.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, Cayton, stop them, please!" he bawled.
</p>

<p>
Roger's head seemed to twitch a little, but he did
not turn it in their direction, nor did he move his hands
from behind his back.  He continued his placid walk,
and, before Grain could call out again, Little John's
muffler had done its work in silencing him.
</p>

<p>
Once within the Forest he knew himself to be
entirely at the mercy of his captors, and ceased to throw
his limbs about in wasted effort.
</p>

<p>
"Now, by my troth, thou shalt answer for much
thou hast done in the past," said Robin, assuming the
post of judge.  "Didst thou, on the night of our
entertainment, see an oil-lamp on the stage knocked
over by an apple, and tongues of fire burst therefrom?"
</p>

<p>
"Carrots!" was Grain's irreverent reply.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art a right saucy varlet, sirrah!  Answer me
'yea' or 'nay'.  Didst see the apple thrown?"
</p>

<p>
"Fish and fiddlesticks!" snorted Grain, looking
more defiant than he felt.
</p>

<p>
"Thou wilt not answer sensibly, but preferreth to
play the right-down giddy goat.  So be it.  My
Merry Men, jerk up the prisoner's head.  He squinteth
upon the ground as though still seeking for grub that
is not his own.  That's better!  Now, caitiff, watch
me carefully.  Dost recognize this?"
</p>

<p>
With a dramatic jerk, Robin drew from his pocket
the russet apple which Little John had picked up from
the stage after the fire.
</p>

<p>
Grain wriggled again in the hands of his captors,
colouring with surprise, and frowning with annoyance.
Never could a face have betrayed guilty knowledge
more clearly than his did at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"More play-acting," he managed to sneer.  "What
has all this rot to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
"More than thou wottest of.  I tell thee to thy face
that thou didst hurl this very apple at the stage,
smashing a lamp and setting the scenery afire.  Didst then
come to help to put out the flames thou hadst
caused?  No, like the cowardly Squirm thou art, thou
tookest to thy heels, and left us to battle with the fire
as best we could."
</p>

<p>
"Cut it short," growled Grain.
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Robin, promptly.  "Boys, tie his
hands firmly behind his back.  Little John, bring
forth the bucket of ice-cold water."
</p>

<p>
The bucket was produced and Robin dropped the
apple into it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, caitiff, kneel," he commanded, "and with
thy mouth pick thy precious russet from the water.
Quick, or thou wilt rue it!"
</p>

<p>
"I knew you'd be up to some dirty trick or other,"
Grain growled.  "I won't play bob-apple to please
you or anybody, that's flat."
</p>

<p>
"Then put his face in, my Merry Men," said Robin.
"'Twill take no harm from an extra wash, I'll warrant ye."
</p>

<p>
Ready hands thrust Grain to his knees and immersed
his face in the bucket.  The water was freezing cold,
and one dose was quite enough.  Swallowing his
pride, he began frantically trying to snatch out the
apple with his mouth.  Each time it bobbed serenely
away from him, to the vast amusement of the spectators,
who felt no pity for this helpless Squirm, himself a far
greater tormentor of younger boys than they now were
of him.  It was a very small price he was paying for
the cruel "fun" he had given himself for so long
a time.
</p>

<p>
If any of you have tried, at the sports, for the sheer
jollity of the thing, to stop with your mouth the
swimming of an apple in a pail of water, you will know how
tantalizing a task it is.  You will have attempted it in
summer, too, in sun-warmed water, whereas Grain
had to dip his face into water that had previously been
covered with ice.  The more frantically he tried to end
the ordeal the farther away did the maddening apple
float.  Finally, he did what he had so often seen the
little victims of his own tormenting do.  He burst into
tears.
</p>

<p>
"I c&mdash;can't c&mdash;catch it!" he wailed.  "Lemme go!"
</p>

<p>
The Merry Men ceased laughing at once and looked
at one another rather foolishly.  Grain, the swaggerer,
crying like a baby!  What a hollow fraud he was&mdash;a
pricked balloon!
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, chaps," said Robin.  "Wipe his face
with a handkerchief, somebody.  Grain, if I untie
your hands and let you go, will you confess to having
thrown that apple?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I d&mdash;did it."
</p>

<p>
"And was it you who squirted acid on our bonfire,
nearly suffocating us all?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;yes; lemme loose!"
</p>

<p>
"Untie his hands, chaps.  Stop blubbing, Grain;
you'll be free in a minute.  Nice chap you are to want
to be leader of any band, even of the stupid Squirms.
Osbody's a swankpot, but he's got pluck to back it up.
You're a bully, a cad, and a baby.  Here's your cap.
Put it on&mdash;scoot!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
Dick has Friendship thrust upon Him
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The lighter the heart the better the work.  Roger
performed wonders in the Christmas examinations, and
"did Rooke's proud" by taking as many prizes as
Harwood did.  Indeed, one of his scalps was the
English Literature prize&mdash;a real jar for Harwood,
whose supremacy in that subject had never been
previously challenged.
</p>

<p>
"Owe that entirely to the practice I got writing for
the <i>Rag</i>, Dick," Roger chuckled.  "Topping prize,
too&mdash;well-bound set of Shakespeare.  Old Wykeham
didn't half like his 'pet lamb' losing it.  He looked
positively sour as Lady Maingay handed me the
goods!"
</p>

<p>
"Imagination, old boy!" laughed Dick.  "All the
same, I'm overjoyed you pulled it off so finely.  Rooke's
House wears a feathered cap to-day.  What'll you say
when Harwood comes across to congratulate you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing!  Shan't have the chance.  He won't come."
</p>

<p>
Nor did he.  It was breaking-up time, and Luke
Harwood probably found enough to do in Holbeck's
House without going out of his way to congratulate his
rival.  Moreover, he had other excuses for jealousy,
inasmuch as the whole school seemed to be laughing
over Roger's delicious burlesque of the burglary, with
its cleverly-rhymed raillery of the bewildered local
police.
</p>

<p>
Indisputably the new magazine outshone the old on
this occasion.  Mr. Rooke and Mr. Holbeck, masters
of rival houses, were seen chuckling over it together,
and no success on the playing-fields of Foxenby could
have thrilled the Captain so much.  It sent him off for
the Christmas holidays with a brighter feeling than he
had known for weeks, and he went straight to his aunt
on his arrival home, confident that in her he would find
the solution of all his money troubles.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Bella was a tall, athletic, merry-featured
woman&mdash;a tennis champion and a golf-prize winner
still, but very much prouder of "her boy's" feats than
she was of her own.  Usually her eyes twinkled with
the joy of living, but to-day Dick was startled and
embarrassed to see her cheeks wet with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Cry-baby, am I not, dear lad?" she said.  "I quite
meant to be as bright as a button when you arrived, but
evidently I am not of the stuff from which heroines are
made.  I'm an elderly woman in distress, and I can't
hide it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, Auntie, who's been making you
wretched?  Show me the blighter and I'll go for him
and punch his head, though he be as big as a house-side."
</p>

<p>
Half-laughing and half-crying, Aunt Bella pinched
Dick's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy, you scent a love-romance!  It's nothing
like that.  And there are two reasons why you cannot
punch his head.  He's small and insignificant and
three times your age.  Also he's in jail!"
</p>

<p>
Alarm shot through Dick's heart.  "Why, Aunt
Bella, have you had a burglar, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Too?" Aunt Bella repeated, looking interested.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;we've had a burglary at school, but never
mind that now&mdash;tell me about the chap that's in jail,
and why."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's the old tale, Dick.  Lonely widow seeks
solace in golf&mdash;leaves trusted lawyer to manage her
affairs&mdash;wakes up one morning to find that he has
coolly spent all the money she has asked him to put out
on mortgage."
</p>

<p>
"The blackguard!" cried Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not the only sufferer&mdash;I can survive it
better than some of his other clients, notably the
officers' widows, poor souls.  Still, I shall have to give
up this house and go into rooms, which I hate.  Moreover,
I shall lose my golf, which is worse."
</p>

<p>
Dick, never a great spokesman, was overwhelmed by
this story of his aunt's misfortune.  His own trouble,
of which he had been so full a few minutes before,
went clean out of his head.  Vainly he racked his
brains for words of comfort and sympathy.  A tragedy
like this was too deep for glib consolation.
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Auntie, I hope he gets fifteen years," he
blurted out at last.  "You're a brick to laugh over it.
Let&mdash;let's get out of this and have a round of
golf&mdash;not for the last time, either.  Things are bound to
come out all right.  There'll be something saved from
the wreck."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Bella's eyes shone almost happily now.  "God
bless you, dear boy, for your cheeriness!" she said.
"You've bucked me up no end.  Golf?  Why,
certainly.  We need another enthusiast in the family
to carry on the good work.  Come, I'll teach
you something that even a football captain doesn't
know!"
</p>

<p>
From that day until the morning of his return to
Foxenby, Dick kept his mouth shut about his
difficulties at school.  Twice Aunt Bella pressed him for
particulars of the burglary, and each time he laughed
the matter off.  She must never know how greatly the
pocket-money she could no longer send would be
missed.  Clearly, he could never take a farthing from
her again, and it mortified him to be unable to volunteer
the return of at least some of the cash with which, from
his babyhood upwards, she had always so lavishly
supplied him.
</p>

<p>
In his widowed stepmother it was impossible to
confide.  She just did endure his presence in the house
at holiday times, and that was all.  She had no use for
"a hobble-de-hoy stepson", she had been heard to
say, and quite frankly grudged him what, under his
father's will, she was compelled to pay for his education.
</p>

<p>
In these cheerless circumstances Dick decided to
return to school a day before the other fellows did, and
to make a hole in his scanty allowance by putting up
for one night at the village inn.  Thus, he would be
enabled to see the publisher of the <i>Rag</i> and explain
things.  Practically it amounted to throwing himself
on the printing-manager's mercy, much as his pride
revolted against that course.
</p>

<p>
At Peterborough everybody alighted from the East
Coast express save one man, a heavily-built individual
with a square jaw and glittering black eyes.  He was
dressed in tweeds of a "horsey" pattern, and the
moment the train re-started he thrust into Dick's arms
a sheaf of coloured sporting papers.
</p>

<p>
"Good biz!" he wheezed.  "Now that those over-fried
old pelicans have buzzed off, we can breathe.
Open that window, sonny!  You and I can suck in
some winter ozone without needing a
bronchitis-kettle, what?"
</p>

<p>
Disinclined for conversation, wanting to be alone
with his thoughts, yet incapable of being surly with
anyone, Dick acknowledged the loan of the papers and
turned the leaves disinterestedly.
</p>

<p>
"Not much in your line, sonny, eh?  Well, chuck
'em into the rack&mdash;the porter'll simply eat 'em.
Can't size up them letters on your cap.  What's
your school?  Foxenby!  Why, that's the team which
drew with St. Cuthbert's in the final.  Shan't forget
that match in a hurry.  Lost a hundred pounds
on it!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't say so!" exclaimed Dick, surprised into
a show of interest.  "Did you have your pockets
picked?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so very much, youngster.  I'd like to see the
crook that could pick my pocket and live.  When I say
that I lost a hundred pounds, I mean that I stood to
win that sum if Foxenby had scored.  Everybody in
Walsbridge had a bit on with me&mdash;and they backed
St. Cuthbert's to a man.  Consequence was, when that
dotty waxwork of a mascot chipped in and spoilt the
Foxenby centre-forward's goal, I lost a little fortune as
clean as a whistle."
</p>

<p>
Dick stared at the bookmaker in unconcealed amazement
and disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Do you say that people actually betted on the
match&mdash;an amateur game between rival schools?" he
asked.  "It's preposterous&mdash;incredible!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, sonny, how old are you&mdash;where were
you brought up?  You're either younger than you
look, or grass-green for your age.  What good's a
football match&mdash;any sort of match, boxing, cricket,
whatever you like&mdash;if people can't have a little bet on
it?  Tripe&mdash;ditchwater!"
</p>

<p>
Dick flushed with annoyance.  "The cup final was
pure sport," he declared.  "To bet on it was positively
vile.  If you were encouraging people to do so, you
ought to have been warned off the ground."
</p>

<p>
The bookie laughed harshly at this straight hit.
"Oh, I wasn't there in person, sonny&mdash;what I know
of the game was from hearsay.  But if you didn't have
a little gamble on it yourself, there are other Foxenby
chaps who did."
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie!" Dick hotly denied.  "There isn't a
fellow in Foxenby who would be skunk enough to play
it so low down."
</p>

<p>
"All serene, young feller&mdash;keep your hair on.  I
know what I know, but we'll not talk about it, as I
never betray a client.  Anyhow, if that young Foxenby
chap had scored, there'd have been a five-pound note
in the school letter-box for him next day.  Just a
friendly memento, so to speak, and no questions
asked."
</p>

<p>
"And straight to the police-station it would have
gone, too," was Dick's indignant comment.  "If you
try buying over a 'Fox' to your dirty betting business,
you'll find yourself in Queer Street, whoever you are."
</p>

<p>
The bookie gazed across at him with serenely-smiling
eyes.  "What ho!" he cried.  "When I see
shells, I guess eggs.  So you were the Foxenby
centre-forward that day, eh?  Well, youngster, I like spirit.
Slang me back-and-edge, call me dud names, tear my
honest business to tatters, but accept my congratulations
as a sportsman on the clinking game you played
that day.  My pals still talk about it."
</p>

<p>
Now Dick was no snob, and too genuinely boyish
not to appreciate a word of praise, from whatever
quarter it came.  Besides, he realized that the man was
to be his travelling companion for the remainder of the
journey, and that no discouragement could silence him.
So, while saying as little as possible himself, he let the
bookmaker run on, and at last found himself being
entertained, in spite of his prejudice, by the man's racy
reminiscences of famous sporting events of the
past-great boxing contests between world champions,
doughty wrestling matches in the Westmorland hills,
exciting International games won "dead on time",
all mingled with less savoury stories of the shady side
of sport, where combatants were kidnapped, drugged,
or bribed to lose, so that huge sums of money might
go dishonestly into the pockets of the betting-ring.
</p>

<p>
The man was a born story-teller, and his determination
to be friendly was such that he insisted on sharing
with Dick the contents of a very excellent luncheon-basket.
This the Captain frankly enjoyed, and said so.
</p>

<p>
"Yet it took me twenty minutes to persuade you to
have a bite," laughed the bookmaker triumphantly.
"Look here, lad, we shall soon be at Moston, and
perhaps I shan't see you again, though I'm generally
knocking about near the market-place.  Now, I like
you.  You've called me a liar and a thief&mdash;that's
straight talking, and better than a cisternful of 'soft
soap', though it isn't true of 'Chuck' Smithies, the
commission agent.  Still, I've enjoyed your society,
and you can always remember you've got a pal in me
if ever you're 'up against it', and want a lift.  Here's
Moston, and the best of friends must part, as the old
song says.  Come, now, are we going to shake hands
or not?"
</p>

<p>
He put out his hand in an awkward fashion, quite
obviously expecting Dick to ignore it.  But the Captain
gripped it without hesitation, and smiled rather shyly
back.
</p>

<p>
"You've been good to me," he said.  "I hate
betting&mdash;yours is a putrid business&mdash;but if I've said
anything to hurt your feelings, wash it out.  I'm
sorry!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
The Printer is Polite no Longer
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Christmas appeared to have upset the liver of the
printer of <i>The Rooke's House Rag</i>.  He was half-way
down Dick's throat, in a manner of speaking, the
moment that unfortunate young editor entered the
works.
</p>

<p>
"There'll be no more copies of your precious
magazine issued from this establishment, I warn you,"
he flared.  "Call yourself captain of a gentlemen's
school!  You're captain of a lot of prigs and bullies,
that's what you are!"
</p>

<p>
Dick was getting used to reverses of fortune
nowadays, and he received this outburst calmly.
</p>

<p>
"I've some recollection that you called me the soul
of honour last term," he replied.  "Now you
apparently think me a hooligan."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say that.  But you're a captain of hooligans
all the same, Mr. Forge.  A nice life you let them lead
my poor boy last term!  I sent him to Foxenby to
learn to be a gentleman&mdash;not having had the advantages
of a public-school education myself&mdash;and instead
he's set-upon and browbeaten daily by gangs of young
blackguards, and you never lift a finger to protect him."
</p>

<p>
Dick looked bewildered.  "I don't know what you're
talking about," he said.  "How, please, does this
concern me?  Your son at Foxenby!  Who, pray, may
that be?"
</p>

<p>
"My name is Mawdster, and my son's name is
Peter.  Now, perhaps you'll 'get' me.  My poor,
delicate boy has been shockingly ill-treated, and you've
stood by and looked on.  Come, you don't deny it,
Mr. Forge."
</p>

<p>
This was truly an eye-opener to Dick.  Clear as
noonday now became the mystery of young Mawdster's
championship of the <i>Rag</i>.  That parting shot of his,
in which he had told the co-editors that he had not
meant to praise the contents of the <i>Rag</i>, but only its
printing and "make-up", was fully explained.  The
manager of the Cleartype Press and the fat, unhealthy
Squirm were father and son.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Mawdster, I admit that your boy has
become unpopular with his class-mates, but he boards
in Holbeck's House and is therefore not under my
protection.  His remedy for ill-treatment lies with his own
prefect and housemaster.  I cannot interfere in any
circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, can't you, Mr. High-and-mighty Captain!"
snarled the manager, mocking Dick's dignified tones.
"But you'll jolly well have to, or I'll know the reason
why.  You've got into my ribs for a lot of money&mdash;more
perhaps than you dream of&mdash;and I guess I hold
the whip-hand of you all right.  You'll either take my
poor boy's part at Foxenby or sup sorrow, Mr. Forge."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be vulgar, and don't be absurd, Mr. Mawdster.
Keep business and private affairs apart.
Admittedly, I cannot pay you yet for publishing the
magazine, but on that account you shall not blackmail
me."
</p>

<p>
At this the manager suddenly dropped his threatening
manner, and became more like his old suave self.  He
commenced to wheedle.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Mr. Forge, don't let us quarrel, you
and me," he said.  "You've got a rare lot of power at
Foxenby if you like to use it.  I appeal to you as a
father.  I love my boy&mdash;he's the only child we've got,
and it cost a little fortune to rear him, he was so weak
at first.  But I'd spend another fortune&mdash;ay, all I've
got in the world&mdash;to see him happy and to know he
was making nice chums amongst gentlemen's sons up
yonder.  Stop them bullyin' him, Mr. Forge, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And what?" asked Dick.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll present you with a signed receipt for every
penny that your magazine has cost me," the printer
blurted out.  "I say, that's fair, isn't it?  You
couldn't have a more sporting offer."
</p>

<p>
Beneath his calm exterior Dick was conscious of a
heart that beat quickly and uncomfortably.  Here, if
he could bring himself to adopt it, was a way out of
all his difficulties!  But he gave no second thought to
the temptation.
</p>

<p>
"It is neither a sporting offer nor a workable one,
Mr. Mawdster," he answered, without hesitation.  "I
am sorry you are unhappy about your son, but I can
do nothing for him."
</p>

<p>
"What!  You, the Captain of Foxenby, can't save
my poor lad from being beaten black and blue?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you I cannot.  It would be an
unpardonable breach of school etiquette."
</p>

<p>
"Etiquette be blowed!" cried the manager.  "You've
got to stick up for my boy, or else&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Drop that, Mr. Mawdster.  I won't be threatened.
If you are dissatisfied with your son's treatment, why
don't you write to his housemaster, or direct to the
Head himself?"
</p>

<p>
"And have the poor, dear lad hounded out of the
place as a tell-tale!  Not much, young fellow&mdash;he's
suffered enough already without that.  See here,
Mr. Stiff-neck Forge, you and I have got to have a straight
talk about this editorial stunt of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  That's why I came here so soon."
</p>

<p>
"I've published three numbers of the magazine on
art paper, and they've cost a lot of money.  If I pass
you the bill now, can you pay it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to say I cannot."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  You're a minor, and therefore I
can't sue you in the County Court.  I knew of that
risk when I took your job on, but I trusted to your
honour as a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"You shall be paid every farthing in the end."
</p>

<p>
"So you say!  But I'm not prepared to wait.  Either
you'll pay now, on the nail, or you'll protect my boy
from insult and injury!"
</p>

<p>
"I have already explained that I can do neither."
</p>

<p>
The two faced each other angrily now.  No quarter
was asked or given.
</p>

<p>
"Is that your last word, Mr. Forge?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite!"
</p>

<p>
"Then your blood be on your own stupid head.  A
fortnight from to-day, when your next number is due
to be published, I shall go to your headmaster and
tell him how you've let me in!  Politely ask him, I
shall, to write to your people about it, or to give me
their address so's I can write them myself."
</p>

<p>
At once Dick's thoughts turned home in alarm to
his distressed aunt and disdainful stepmother.  There
were strong reasons, of a different character, why
neither should know of his humiliating bother.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't do that, Mr. Mawdster, please!" he
pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that touches you, does it?" sneered the printer.
"You wince now, my proud young aristocrat.  Well,
I rather thought you'd see reason in the end.  You've
got a fortnight's grace.  Stretch a protectin' wing over
my poor, delicate boy, and all will be well.  Be
pig-headed, and it won't!  Your people will know all
about it, and so will the whole school.  Nice pie for
the editor of <i>The Foxonian</i>, eh?  He won't half smack
his lips over it!"
</p>

<p>
These were the taunting words which followed Dick
through the doorway as he wisely decided to go.  It
was a relief to pass from the stuffy printing-office into
the clear air of a frosty January afternoon.  Out in the
street he had rather less of the feeling of a rat caught
hopelessly in a trap.
</p>

<p>
"The beggar has me by the throat," he groaned
inwardly.  "Either I've got to save the skin of his
corpulent skunk of a son, or be shown up at home and
here as a fellow who doesn't pay his debts.  Dear old
Roger little guessed what a rod he was making for my
back when he egged me on to start journalism."
</p>

<p>
It was the Moston half-holiday, and farm-lads were
strolling about in their best bell-bottomed trousers, in
search of more amusement than the little place was
capable of providing.  Some of them had gathered in
the Tavern Square, and were entertaining themselves
by roughly baiting Fluffy Jim, the village idiot.
</p>

<p>
One big rustic, probably about eighteen years of age,
though he had the beginnings of a strong beard on his
unbarbered chin, was holding Fluffy Jim's head tightly
between his legs while the other lads took turns at
knocking dust out of the idiot's clothes with the
ash-sticks and canes they carried.
</p>

<p>
"Nah then, yo' chaps, let drive at him," shouted the
biggest tyrant.  "Iverybody as makes him 'bale oot'
scoöars one point, and them chaps 'at he 'shoots'
moöast for gets a fat cigar apiece!"
</p>

<p>
To "bale oot" and to "shoot" meant the same
thing in the dialect of the district&mdash;the poor half-witted
boy was to be made to shout out in pain beneath
the succession of strokes, and from this cruel pastime
the yokels were obviously deriving coarse amusement.
Now, Dick had no reason to feel tenderly disposed
towards the village idiot, who had had so much to do with
one of the greatest disappointments of his life.
Nevertheless his blood boiled as he joined the little crowd of
watchers, some of them elderly men, and realized that,
far from showing any desire to interfere, they seemed
actually to be enjoying the "fun".
</p>

<p>
Dick had meant going straight into the inn to claim
the shelter of the snug little private room which he had
booked.  His brain was in a whirl, and above everything
he craved quietude.  His last wish was to be
mixed up in a brawl with skylarking farm-hands.  The
Captain of Foxenby could not really afford the luxury
of a "scrap" in the open street.
</p>

<p>
A very genuine howl of agony from Fluffy Jim
settled the matter, however.  Dick suddenly appeared
in the centre of the laughing rustics, and tapped the
leader of them on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, you," he said, curtly.  "Let Fluffy
Jim go.  He's had enough knocking about for to-day."
</p>

<p>
The young horseman gaped, as well he might, for
this was an audacious thing that the Foxenby schoolboy
had done.  The square was thick with the yokel's
friends, a united rush by whom would speedily have
put the intruder out and under.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by gum!  An' who's thee when tha're at
hoöam?" inquired the horseman.  "Run away to thee
mammy, kid, afoöar tha gets hurt!"
</p>

<p>
Great laughter rewarded this outburst of rural wit.
But Dick's reply, eagerly awaited, was not in words.
Catching hold of the yokel's neckcloth he jerked him
smartly back, thereby releasing Fluffy Jim from that
unhappy youth's painful position.  In an instant there
was angry uproar.
</p>

<p>
"Hit 'im in t'mooth, Juddy!  Clart 'im in t'lug,
lad!  Rub 'is cheeky nose in t'snow, Juddy, boy!"
</p>

<p>
Thus urged on all sides to action, "Juddy" bunched
together a fist of terrifying size, swung it round a few
times to emphasize its power, and then lifted it
carefully to the level of Dick's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"See that?" he said.  "It's what tha're goin' to get
for interferin' wi' the likes o' me.  Ah've gi'en thee
fair warnin', so look art!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-132"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-132.jpg" alt="&quot;SEE THAT?&quot; HE SAID" />
<br />
&quot;SEE THAT?&quot; HE SAID
</p>

<p>
He drew back his arm to strike, and Dick, secretly
somewhat dismayed by the size of the fist he had been
invited to inspect, got ready to defend himself.  Then
it was that the landlord of the "Anvil Inn", an old
quartermaster-sergeant, took a hand in the game.
</p>

<p>
"Not here, gentlemen, I beg," said he.  "Do you
both want to spend a night in the lock-up?  There's
the bowling-green behind, nice and handy.  If you
must fight, come and have it out there!"
</p>

<p>
This fresh turn of events was still more hateful to
Dick, who would have preferred to be done with the
unfortunate affair after a quick set-to in the open.  But
some gratis sport of a thrilling character was exactly
what the crowd wanted, and they swept both Dick and
the horseman, willy-nilly, on to the snow-covered
bowling-green at the rear.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, gents, you all know me as an old boxer
and a clean sportsman," the landlord shouted.  "So
I'll be referee and see fair play.  Juddy here will have
plenty of supporters, but who's going to hold the
sponge for the representative of Foxenby?"
</p>

<p>
"I will, old bean," said a man at the back of the
crowd, which parted to make way for him.  "Give me
your coat, youngster.  I'll see you through this all
right."
</p>

<p>
And it was with a thankful heart that Dick saw
"Chuck" Smithies, his travelling companion of the
previous day, elbowing his way towards him.  In this
hostile crowd he was now assured of at least one friend!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
The Fight on the Bowling-green
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There are some boys so serene of temper that they
can go through school life without a serious quarrel
with anyone.  Dick Forge was a boy of this type.  He
had risen from the First Form at Foxenby to his
present responsible position as captain of the school
without having had a single pugilistic encounter of any
moment.  Still, he was too all-round an athlete not to
have gained a sound knowledge of boxing, and he was
nail-hard physically.  It was not the ability but the
desire to fight that he lacked.
</p>

<p>
Now that he had done what he deemed to be his
duty in releasing Fluffy Jim from torture, he had no
grudge against the big young horseman with whom he
found himself matched.  He felt listless about the
matter&mdash;bored by it, though keenly alive to the necessity
of keeping that huge red hand as far as possible from
his face and body.  One fair smack from such a
leg-o'-mutton fist might well serve to put him to bed for a
week, which would be particularly awkward.
</p>

<p>
For fully three rounds, therefore, he remained
entirely on the defensive, much to the disappointment
of the crowd, who saw no merit in his performance of
side-stepping and dancing beyond the reach of their
champion's writhing arms.  To them that indicated
cowardice, with which they freely taunted him.
</p>

<p>
"Hit him hard, an' knock his teeth oot, Juddy,"
they urged.  "Barge cloöase up tiv him!"
</p>

<p>
Which, being interpreted, meant: "Get close up to
him"&mdash;excellent counsel, but rather more difficult to
follow than they realized.
</p>

<p>
"Keep on playing him, lad&mdash;that's right," whispered
Chuck Smithies, encouragingly.  "He'll tire first at
this game.  Has no more idea of boxing than a
backwoods-man.  But you mustn't let him hit you,
mind&mdash;he'll knock you sick if he gets one in."
</p>

<p>
"I wish it were over," said Dick, devoutly.  "It's
such a farce.  There's really so little to fight about."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, true enough, that village idiot seems to be
your evil star," the bookmaker agreed.  "Like fighting
for a block of wood, sure!  But you butted in to save
him, sonny, so you've got to stick it out.  Buck up!
Juddy's coming for you baldheaded this time."
</p>

<p>
Yes, Juddy was indeed in most desperate earnest on
this occasion.  With all the vocal support on his side,
and a big advantage in weight, he had every inducement
to force the fight to an early and successful issue.  If, he
told himself, he could slam his fist once, just once, into
the schoolboy's face&mdash;so cool a face it was, too, as it
tantalizingly bobbed up and down in front of him&mdash;there
would be a straight road into the public-house,
drinks round at some hero-worshipper's expense, and
three cheers for a jolly good fellow.  The said "good
fellow" being, as a matter of course, Juddy himself.
</p>

<p>
Dazzled by the prospect of such hero-worship,
Juddy made the pace "mustard".  Twice his
sledge-hammer fist got near enough to sting and redden
Dick's ear&mdash;another inch to the left and the schoolboy
would have gone down like a felled ox.  Every artifice in
Dick's box-of-tricks had to be brought into play before
the termination of that hurricane round.  It left him
badly in need of his second wind, but unhurt.
Moreover it had begun to dawn on a section of the crowd
that the swiftness of his movements was not altogether
due to funk, and some few amongst them shuffled
round to his side of the ring.
</p>

<p>
"Ahr Juddy ain't hevin' it all his own roöad this
journey," observed one elderly farm-hand, puffing
thoughtfully at his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Noa," his mate agreed.  "T'young feller from
t'schule seems ter hev some soöart of a game on.
Leastways, Juddy canna fetch him one."
</p>

<p>
"Cos why?  Cos t'schule kid's 'wick' on his feet,"
put in another, wiser than the rest.  "He's t'captain
o' t'foöitball team, an' it wor him as would ha' scored
t'winnin' goal at Walsbridge if Fluffy Jim hedn't spoilt
him."
</p>

<p>
"What!  And after that he runs up agin Juddy to
save Jim fro' a hidin'!  Why, if Ah'd been him, Ah'd
hev seen Jim cold as frozen mutton fust."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, that's soöart o' thing they do in them big
schules, tha knows.  'Code of honour' they calls it,
Ah'm telled.  Of all the daft ideas&mdash;hey, sitha," he
broke off, "what a sissup Juddy's just given him!"
</p>

<p>
"Sitha, what a sissup" was the yokel's way of
announcing to those behind him that their champion
had at last "got home" with that vicious right hand
of his.  An exultant cheer marked the success.  Dick
spun round with the jarring shock, and in that
helplessly sick moment he would have fallen an easy prey
to Juddy's next blow but for a lucky chance.  Dick
slipped on the snow of the improvised prize-ring, worn
glassy by now, and thereby escaped the full force of
his opponent's second drive.  As it was, blood flowed
from a cut on his cheek, which Chuck Smithies had
difficulty in stanching.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I warn you not to let him hit you?" he
grumbled.  "One more swipe on the napper like that,
and you'll be dreaming of home and mother, sonny."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so particular what happens," gasped Dick,
in his giddy agony.  "Can't stop rotting about here
all afternoon."
</p>

<p>
He was dimly conscious that Chuck Smithies was
breathing fire and brimstone into his ear as he rose to
face the next round.  He was quite too badly shaken
for the time being, to realize that his triumph-flushed
opponent was blowing like the bellows of a
blacksmith's shop.
</p>

<p>
Juddy was no pierrot, and the unaccustomed prancing
he had done before "clumpin' t'schule-kid's
chump" had almost emptied his lungs of ozone.
Greatly to the chagrin of his supporters, he seemed
quite unable to break again through Dick's somewhat
groggy guard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Juddy, lad," they passionately pleaded, "dew
slap it across him.  He nobbut needs a push&mdash;why, tha
could blow him o'er!"
</p>

<p>
Which was precisely what Juddy could not do.  He
could scarcely have cooled his porridge with the breath
that was left in him just then.  Still, there was no
reduction in the carthorse strength of his muscles, as
the bruises on Dick's protective arms could have
testified.  Both of them came out of that round with
diminished glory, and the referee cast anxious glances
back at his neglected public-house, darkly hinting at a
draw "if things don't buck up quick".
</p>

<p>
"They're pumped, both of 'em," observed a candid
critic.  "You could wring 'em out like a couple o'
dishcloths.  What a frost!"
</p>

<p>
And a "frost" it most likely would have been, with
a bored-stiff schoolboy on one side, and a Puffing Billy
of a horseman on the other, had not Mr. Mawdster,
dressed in his Sunday best, and obviously "out for the
afternoon", taken advantage of a parting in the crowd
to insinuate himself amongst the foremost spectators.
There, with his nose superciliously wrinkled, and a
contemptuous smile playing on his thin lips, he formed
a conspicuous figure which Dick could not fail to note,
even though one of the schoolboy's eyes was rapidly
closing under a puff of tender skin.
</p>

<p>
The scorn of an enemy is the surest form of tonic to
a fighter of mettle.  The printer, deliberately meaning
to be insulting, did Dick an immeasurable kindness.
Pride surged up like a red sea in the school captain's
veins.  The feeling of numbness passed from them&mdash;they
tingled into leaping life.
</p>

<p>
"The worm's come here to gloat over me being
pole-axed," he decided.  "Very well, I'll disappoint
him.  Juddy Whatshisname, Esquire, can look out for
his eye now.  I'm going to fight!"
</p>

<p>
Into the ring he jumped, a new man from head to
foot.  No more back-pedalling and side-stepping&mdash;no
more trelliswork-formation of defending arms before
an elusive head.  Dick sought out his opponent with
a refreshing newness of purpose which astonished
everyone, more particularly the young horseman, who
was called upon to shield himself for the first time, and
plainly didn't know how to do it.
</p>

<p>
Rap, rap went Dick's knuckles between the yokel's
wide-set eyes.  No damage done, apparently!  Dick
ducked to avoid the round-armed return blow, and
brought his left instantly to Juddy's jaw.  "Ugh!"
grunted Juddy, but that was all.  A weather-beaten
head like his could stand a lot of pommelling.
</p>

<p>
"Like hitting a wooden Highlander outside a
snuff-shop," Dick inwardly commented.  "Nil
desperandum!  I'll hurt him yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Hit him on t'neb, Foxey&mdash;hit him on t'neb," came
a familiar voice from the crowd&mdash;the hoarse voice of
Fluffy Jim.
</p>

<p>
The village idiot was not quite so daft after all!
While the fight had been going against his champion
he had kept a shut mouth&mdash;he was sharp enough to
realize the change in the feelings of the crowd, which
made it safe at last to venture on an encouraging
yell.  He knew, too, that his own body would
probably be free from violence for a long time to come
if Juddy were beaten now.  This time he was to be a
help, not a hindrance, to the Captain of Foxenby, who
really appreciated a heartening cheer at the turn of the
tide.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, sonny!" cried Chuck Smithies, at the end
of the round.  "You've sparred him to a standstill.
But that isn't enough by a jugful.  The shades of
night will fall before you knock him down by hammering
his dial.  I know these farm-hands&mdash;bred on beef
and bacon pasties&mdash;tough as prairie grass.  The
referee is fidgeting to declare it a draw; if the police
pop in and catch him amusing himself like this, they'll
haul him before the beak.  There's only one way to
end it.  Just one spot to hit Juddy on&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The solar plexus?" queried Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Don't recommend it; too dangerous, even if you
could locate it.  No, you must tap him on the neck;
here, behind the ear."
</p>

<p>
"Any risk of serious harm?"
</p>

<p>
"None whatever.  Absolute kindness to animals,
my dear boy.  Safer than chloroform.  He'll go to
sleep like a babe for a few minutes, that's all.  Now,
at it again.  It's cat-and-mouse, lad, so put him out of
his misery, sharp!"
</p>

<p>
The village idiot's voice, still harping on the necessity
of smiting Juddy's "neb", boomed out again, and the
crowd's sympathy seemed now to veer to Dick's side.
After all, many of the farm boys had gone too long
in fear of Juddy the Unconquered&mdash;a wholesome
pasting, they began to think, would do him no harm!
</p>

<p>
He seemed to know what was in store for him, too,
for his crouching attitude as Dick approached him was
curiously suggestive of an exhausted bull awaiting the
dash of a matador.
</p>

<p>
A pang of perilous pity shot through Dick's heart,
so woebegone did his rival look.  But the recollection
of the torture this hulking bully had inflicted on
Fluffy Jim served to steel his heart.  Conscious that
the round was wholly his, he lured the tired giant into
the exact position necessary for the <i>coup de grace</i>.  Then,
setting his teeth, he followed Chuck Smithies' directions
ruthlessly.  To his unutterable relief, the medicine
worked like a charm.
</p>

<p>
Juddy crumpled up and fell, and was counted out
before his astonished supporters could haul him to his
feet and shake the breath back into his body.
</p>

<p>
Amid the babel which followed, the sportsmanship
of the farm-hands rose to a higher level than had
previously seemed possible.  Rather shamefacedly, as
though they were afraid of being caught at it, they
cheered "t'Foxenby kid", and would have stood him
a good many drinks if he had coveted such a doubtful
appreciation.  But Chuck Smithies shepherded him
into the tavern, and, with those cunning restoratives
known best to frequenters of the prize-ring, modified
the pain and unsightliness of his face and eye.
</p>

<p>
"You're a boxer of parts, sonny," said the admiring
bookie, "but you'd never make a professional bruiser.
Too soft-hearted!  Still, you'll be the talk of the
country-side after outing Juddy Stockgill.  He's been
Cock o' the North two years.  At the school, too,
they'll make no end of a song-and-dance, what?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope to goodness they never hear a syllable about
it," said Dick fervently.
</p>

<p>
The kindly bookmaker stared.
</p>

<p>
"Why, laddie, you ought to be jumping glad to have
your chums know of this victory," he said.   "But you
don't seem happy at all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm all right, thanks.  Don't worry about
me," Dick hastened to say.
</p>

<p>
The bookie adjusted his hat and drew on his gloves
with care.
</p>

<p>
"Well, chin-chin, sonny&mdash;I am hopping it now," he
said.  "Many thanks for a jolly afternoon!  I like
you.  I'm no fair-weather friend.  Remember what I
said to you in the train&mdash;hail me if you're ever in a hole,
and I'll do my little best to dig you out.  Keep on
bathing your eye till bedtime.  Warm water will fetch
the plaster off in the morning.  You'll feel better then
than Clodhopper Juddy, I'll wager a crown!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
The Cloud with the Silver Lining
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Loving Foxenby with all his heart, as one who had
been far happier there than at home, Dick Forge had
always hitherto come back to it in joyful expectation of
pleasant days in store.
</p>

<p>
As its captain he had striven hard, particularly on the
athletic side, to keep it well in the picture, and there
was evidence of his zeal in the hall, where the County
Schools' cricket-shield now hung.  Moreover, he had
steered the Socker team into the final of the football
cup, and there was still a chance of winning that and
bringing off the double event.
</p>

<p>
Never had a winter term started with greater
possibilities, yet Dick entered upon it with leaden feet and
downcast spirits.  It appeared to him that, unless
something approaching a miracle happened in less than a
fortnight, a storm would burst over his head that he
would be unable to weather.  He would have to pack
up stealthily and go.
</p>

<p>
With frank or half-concealed curiosity everybody
stared at his bruised face and half-closed optic.  Old
Man Wykeham, in discussing with him the prospects
of the term, seemed to have eyes for nothing other
than those scars of battle; Mr. Rooke was even more
inquisitive, and made no bones about asking him the
reason of it.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather not say, sir, if you don't mind," Dick
answered.
</p>

<p>
How long, he wondered, would the story of yesterday's
encounter be in making its way to Foxenby?  By
anyone mischievously disposed towards him, it might
so easily be described as "a pothouse brawl".
</p>

<p>
His fears in this direction were only too well
grounded.  Lyon, the cup-team's doughty full-back,
speedily brushed away his last hope that the affair
might never reach the school.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Forge, old man, somebody's set a nasty tale
about concerning you," said the full-back anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's being said?" Dick inquired, fearing
the worst.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, some tin-pot yarn about you picking a quarrel
with a yokel in Moston&mdash;a stupid clown who couldn't
fight for toffee.  The impression is that you were
showing off your superior pugilistic skill, and that you
sort of butchered this unscientific chawbacon to make a
Moston holiday.  Awful rot, of course, but what did
actually happen?"
</p>

<p>
Dick groaned in spirit.  Was he never to enjoy a
minute's freedom from malice?  There could be no
doubt about it&mdash;Lyon was looking hard and pointedly
at his battered and still-swollen face, and it was that
close scrutiny which proved Dick's undoing.  With
all his nerves on edge he lost his temper.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lyon, if you like to believe lots of
confounded tosh, it's your own affair entirely," he burst
out.  "Let the old woman's tale go round the school.
I shall take no trouble to contradict it!"
</p>

<p>
He left Lyon gasping there, and went off in search
of the only person from whom he seemed likely to gain
any sympathy&mdash;Roger Cayton, to wit.  But Roger had
not yet arrived, nor was there any sign that his baggage
had come on in front of him.
</p>

<p>
The absence of the Prefect of Rooke's House on the
first day of a new term was a matter of some concern,
and Dick at once reported it to Mr. Rooke.
</p>

<p>
"I was just coming to see you about that very matter,
Forge," the housemaster said.  "Cayton's father has
written to say that the poor lad is down with cerebral
inflammation."
</p>

<p>
"Ill!" exclaimed Dick, blankly.
</p>

<p>
"Rather seriously, I fear.  Over-study during the
holidays, his father says.  Been working hard, unknown
to the rest of the family, when he ought to have been
in bed.  Trying to make sure of his Varsity
scholarship, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"Do&mdash;do you think I could get leave to go and see
him, sir?" stammered Dick, pale of face and visibly
distressed.
</p>

<p>
"No use if you could, Forge.  They wouldn't
admit you to a delirious patient.  Better wait and
hope for the best.  I'll let you know the bulletins
as they arrive, or you can write for information
yourself."
</p>

<p>
Calamity on calamities!  Trouble heaped on trouble,
pressed down and brimming over.  Deprived of the
moral support of his trustiest friend, Dick had now to
face his editorial dilemma entirely alone, with the added
anguish of knowing that Roger might succumb to the
fever and be for ever lost to him.
</p>

<p>
No shame to the Captain of Foxenby that he locked
himself in his study&mdash;<i>their</i> study&mdash;that night, and, with
his head buried in his-arms, gave way to silent sobbing.
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune were
coming too fast about his ears&mdash;it was more than
human endurance could be expected to withstand!
</p>

<p>
He was soon bitterly angry with himself for this
outburst of grief.  He, the Captain of Foxenby, blubbering
like a First Form kid with the toothache!  A smile
must be pumped up from somewhere for that last walk
along the dormitories&mdash;poor old Roger's work if he had
been there.  It must never be said that Foxenby's
Captain went to bed, on the first night of the term, with
a countenance as long as a fiddle.
</p>

<p>
Pride brought the smile, and sheer physical weariness&mdash;the
reaction of yesterday's fight&mdash;the sleep.  And
in the morning his damaged eye was heaps better, and
the marks of Juddy's fist were far less noticeable.  So
Dick set about his duties with philosophical resignation,
determined to look facts in the face, intent on
wearing a mask of nonchalance which would deceive
all but the shrewdest boys around him.
</p>

<p>
One of his first ordeals was to eat humble-pie over
the <i>Rooke's House Rag</i>.  With many pen-scratchings
and painful recommencements, he prepared and pinned
on the notice-board the following announcement:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>THE ROOKE'S HOUSE RAG</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
Subscribers to the above Magazine are notified
that, pending the recovery of the funds lost in
the burglary last term, the publication of the
Rag has been temporarily suspended.  As
soon as arrangements can be made its issue
will certainly be renewed.  In the meantime,
any Subscriber who desires the return of his
unexpired subscription may receive it on
application to the undersigned,
</p>

<p class="letter">
  Richard Forge,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editor.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The flaw in that literary 'wangle'," thought Dick,
as he gazed ruefully at the foolscap sheet, "is the rash
promise to refund unexpired subscriptions.  If many
of the Foxes take advantage of that, I shall be cleaned
out of 'tin' for the rest of the term."
</p>

<p>
He walked off sharply as though from an unclean
thing.  Had he turned his head, he would have seen
that Luke Harwood was the first to read his public
confession of failure.  And he might have had some
of his laudable faith in human nature torn from him
could he have observed the self-satisfied smirk on the
face of <i>The Foxonian's</i> editor.  "I told him so&mdash;I knew
it," was the verbal key to that smug expression.
</p>

<p>
Luke Harwood had reason to feel at peace with all
the world to-day.  After long waiting, things were
coming his way at last.  This humble suspension of
the <i>Rag</i> would not be exactly popular with those who
had subscribed to it.  They would laugh ironically at
the clause "pending the recovery of the funds lost".
How very likely that the burglars, conscience-stricken,
were saving up stolen money for an opportunity of
returning it!  Then there was that ugly affair at the
public-house&mdash;the fight with the ignorant yokel.  Very
severe things were being said about that in school.  If
any other Fox had been guilty of a vulgar scrap in such
squalid surroundings, would not Forge himself, as
captain, have reported the offender to the Head?
Then, the School was asking, why did not he report
himself?
</p>

<p>
Oh, truly, reflected Luke, when the annual election
of Foxenby's captain took place at Easter, it would not
be altogether such a walk-over for Dick Forge as it had
been in the two previous years!
</p>

<p>
During the rest of that miserable week, better news
of Roger provided the only relief to the background of
dull misery.  Roger, his father wrote to say, had made
a wonderful recovery, and was already itching to get
back to school.  Such good tidings served to sustain
Dick's pluck as he saw, on almost every side, the
growing animosity towards him.  It was suspicious,
too, that nobody had asked for a return of a subscription
to the <i>Rag</i>.  Was that also a conspiracy against
him&mdash;a sort of half-veiled boycott?  Even Lyon, that
reliable old football warhorse, avoided him whenever
possible.  Forge was distinctly in the School's black
books this term.
</p>

<p>
Feeling almost an outcast, Dick grew morose and
silent, and it was with difficulty that he spoke civilly to
Robin Arkness, leader of the Merry Men, when that
bland young gentleman accosted him outside his study
door.
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye want, youngster?" he asked irritably.
"Sing out, quick; I'm busy just now."
</p>

<p>
The quite unexpected answer took him, metaphorically
speaking, off his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, Forge, will you sign your name in my
autograph album?" asked Robin, producing from
behind his back an oblong book in a somewhat grubby,
red-leather binding.
</p>

<p>
"Why, kid, what's the game?  No nonsense, now?
I've a pretty rough way of dealing with Juniors who
try to pull my leg."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, honour bright, Forge, I want your autograph
ever so much," declared Robin with the utmost gravity.
"Put it here, please, on the page I keep for footballers
and boxers."
</p>

<p>
"Boxers!  What are you driving at, you little
monkey?  You are trying to pull my leg, after all!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, no, Forge!  Do sign.  There, underneath
the autograph of the light-weight champion of the
world."
</p>

<p>
Dick found himself breathing rather fast as he
looked from Robin to the book, and from the book back
to Robin again.
</p>

<p>
"Though you don't seem to realize it, younker, this
is rather a tender subject for me," he said at last,
quietly.  "You say you want me to sign your book
amongst the footballers and boxers!  Footballer I may
be, in a measure, but why boxer?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you beat big Juddy Stockgill to a frazzle
on the Anvil Inn bowling-green," Robin replied,
almost reverently.
</p>

<p>
Dick gasped.  This was a newer and altogether
pleasanter version of the episode, anyhow!
</p>

<p>
"But that's not what the School thinks, kid.
Foxenby's opinion is that, for swank, I selected a nice,
fat, juicy victim, and used him as a punching-ball.
Have you heard a different story?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Forge.  But one of the&mdash;that is, somebody
said they'd seen it was Juddy Stockgill you walloped,
and I know what a big brute he is, 'cos my uncle had a
farm next to the one where Juddy works.  And he
must have been doing something rotten, or you wouldn't
have struck him, Forge."
</p>

<p>
Here was a golden opportunity to put things right,
and Dick, after slightly hesitating, took it.
</p>

<p>
"Juddy and his choice associates were knocking
Fluffy Jim about rather badly," he said.  "I chipped
in because of that, kid, and not for personal glory.  You
believe me, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Up to the hilt, Forge!  You're a 'white man'.
Sign my book, please, so's I can 'hop' it back to
'prep'."
</p>

<p>
With a cheerier laugh than he had uttered for weeks,
Dick did himself the unsought honour of placing his
signature beneath that of the world's light-weight
boxing champion, and Robin cleared off contentedly.
</p>

<p>
"Never say die, after all," Dick told himself, more
hopefully.  "With Robin Hood and his Merry Men
behind me, and Roger burning to get back to my side,
I think I can discern a tiny rift in the clouds at last!"
</p>

CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
In which Peter has an Unhappy Day
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Give me back my tin of biscuits, I tell you!  You've
pinched my cakes, chocolates, apples, bananas,
everything.  Cads, thieves, pirates!"
</p>

<p>
"Peace, thou scurvy knave!  Dost dare to speak
slightingly of the great Robin Hood and his Merry
Men?  Have a care, thou pestiferous Squirm, lest I
order thy foul tongue to be torn from its roots by
red-hot pincers."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stop your high-falutin' rot and give me back
my grub.  If you don't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, caitiff, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"As sure as my name's Peter Mawdster I'll report
the whole boiling of you to the Captain of the
School!"
</p>

<p>
"Yah!  Sneak!  Hound!  Soapless Squirm!  Down
with him, Merry Men!  Slug the crawling viper!"
</p>

<p>
"Hold, Merry Men!"  It was the shrill voice of
Robin, raised high in command.  "Soil not your
honest hands with the watery blood of this rapscallion.
Spread yourselves around, so that there may be no
escape for him from the depths of this noble Forest.
I would have speech with him&mdash;words of serious
import indeed!"
</p>

<p>
Hugely enjoying the sport, the Merry Men drew
round Peter Mawdster a cordon that it would have
been hopeless to attempt to break.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mawdster, black-handed imp of the printing
press, slimiest of Squirms," began Robin, "venture
to ope thy sloppy mouth during this speech o' mine,
and my trusty fellows shall immediately stuff it full of
holly leaves and clay, which will please thee less than
the greasy provender which has made thee fat and
scant of breath.  Know now the two charges that
are laid against thee&mdash;firstly, that thou didst carry to
school a disgustingly hoggish hoard of costly viands,
which, rather than share with thy dormitory in the
time-honoured Foxenby fashion, thou didst bring into
the Shrubbery and endeavour to conceal there, like
a dirty overfed dog with a surplus bone."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't!" denied Peter.  "If you'd only waited
I was going to ask everybody to share."
</p>

<p>
Hoots of derision from his captors greeted this
assertion.
</p>

<p>
"Villain!  Thou liest in thy teeth!  Make not thy
odious crime worse by perjury, or thou shalt fare ill at
our hands.  If he speaks again before I've finished,
Merry Men, bung up his mealy mouth!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, worthy leader!" shouted the gleeful band.
</p>

<p>
"Thou hearest, toad of a Squirm?  Silence, on thy
life!  Charge Number Two against thee is that thou
didst, of malice aforethought, bring to Foxenby a
garbled story about its honoured Captain&mdash;to wit,
that at ye royal and ancient sign of Ye Anvil Inn, in ye
historic and flyblown borough of Moston, he did
single out and do grievous bodily harm to a gaping,
flabby, half-baked clodhopper who could make no
show of resistance.
</p>

<p>
"Now," continued Robin, getting a fresh breath
hurriedly, "think well how thou answerest my questions,
as whatever thou lettest slip from thy bloated
lips may be used in evidence against thee.  Didst thou,
or didst thou not, witness the encounter between Forge
and the chawbacon?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;here, give me my grub and let me go, you
fellows!" was the wildly evasive reply.
</p>

<p>
"Stand ready with the clay, my Merry Men!
Answer my question without further ado.  Wert thou
present at the fight?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"Then thy foul slander was the fruit of thy own
squirming and villainous imagination?"
</p>

<p>
"If I wasn't, somebody else was," quavered Peter.
"Gimme my prog!"
</p>

<p>
"Silence in Court&mdash;I mean cease thy gluttonous
wailing after venison pasty.  By my halidom, humble-pie
is fitter fare for such carrion as thou.  For the last
time, from whom didst thou glean the details of the
fistic bout?"
</p>

<p>
"My father saw it, if you must know."
</p>

<p>
"Thy father, eh?  Scullion and knave and thrice
dirty dog!  Who and what is thy sire that his word
should be taken before that of a gentleman of Foxenby?
Didst, then, thy low-born father vow to thee that Forge
made a punching-ball of a crackpot yokel who could
not defend himself?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he did&mdash;and don't you call my father names,
either, Robin!"
</p>

<p>
"But I shall call him names, thou caitiff, and to his
face if I get the chance.  He is a liar and a knave, and
by the shaven crown of Friar Tuck I swear that, should
he ever defile Foxenby with his obnoxious presence,
I and my Merry Men will split his mean carcass with
arrows.  What say ye, Merry Men?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, Robin Hood," was the joyful chorus.
</p>

<p>
"I tell ye, Merry Men," went on Robin, who was
most thoroughly enjoying himself in the imaginary
limelight, "that the doughty opponent of our Captain
was none other than the notorious Juddy Stockgill,
a six-foot-high horseman, four stones heavier (more or
less) than Forge to start with.  Forge caught this hefty
horseman torturing Fluffy Jim, the village idiot, and
forthwith dotted him one on the beak&mdash;that is, I should
say, Forge valiantly took the&mdash;side of the downtrodden
and the Oppressed, and with his trusty quarterstaff&mdash;I
mean to say, his good right arm&mdash;laid the tyrant low!"
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Three cheers for Forge of Foxenby!"
cried the delighted Merry Men.
</p>

<p>
"Gimme me my biscuits and things, and let's be
going," whined Peter, ungrammatically and fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"The fat-producing provender, scoundrel, with
which thou camest boastfully back to school, is easy
enough of access to one of thy elegant figure and
nimbleness of foot.  If thou so delightest in eating,
thou wilt gladly climb for thy food.  Thou wilt find
it dangling from the topmost bough of yonder
sycamore tree, whither the Forest nymphs, disgusted by
thy swinish greed, spirited it."
</p>

<p>
Peter gave a scream of baffled rage as, looking up,
he saw that his basket of eatables had actually been tied
high up in the sycamore tree.  Stout as he was,
sluggish with over-feeding during the Christmas holidays,
the task of climbing that high tree, slippery with
hoar-frost, was quite beyond him.  Stung to reckless fury
by his impotence, he first of all showed Robin his teeth
in an ugly snarl.  Then he set up such a hullabaloo of
weeping as might have been heard a mile away.
</p>

<p>
"Uh, bu-bu-bu-bub-bub-oo!" he blubbered.  "You
know I can't reach it up there, you cads.  I'm not
strong.  (Oh, bub-bub-oo!)  My father's doctor says
I haven't to c-c-climb trees.  I've to have plenty of
rich and sustaining f-f-food, and I'm hungry now.
Gimme my biscuits, bub-bub-bub-oo!"
</p>

<p>
"Bub-bub-bub-oo!" the Merry Men mocked him,
by common consent.  "Gimme my biscuits, bub-bub-bub&mdash;ooo!"
</p>

<p>
What cursed spite was it that turned Dick Forge's
footsteps in the direction of the Shrubbery just then?
Every good reason was his to be conveniently deaf on
that side to-day.  No kudos could be derived from
stopping yet another of the constantly recurring
demonstrations of Robin Hood and his Merry Men.  They
were his only friends in the school just now, and as
such were surely entitled to as much rope as he could
discreetly allow them.  Yet here he was, urged on to
an unpopular action by that stern inner monitor which
we know by the name of Duty.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, you chaps, what's this Bedlam about?"
he demanded.  "Playing at wild beasts escaping from
a menagerie, eh?  There's a howling wolf amongst you,
at any rate.  Why," he exclaimed, as the cordon of
Merry Men parted to admit him, "it's young Mawdster
again!"
</p>

<p>
Peter ceased blubbering as suddenly as he began.
"Yes, Forge, it's me," he said.  "They've slung all
my grub up there in the sycamore tree.  Make 'em
fetch it down for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Whom do you think you're talking to, Mawdster?
Keep your paws off my coat-sleeve, if you please.
Why are you always sneaking about in here, making
disturbances?  Cut off out of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Shan't!" replied Peter, as bold as brass.  He was
even looking rather pleased with himself now.  "I'm
not leaving this shrubbery till they've fetched my grub
out of that tree.  And you'll make 'em do it, Forge!"
</p>

<p>
The Merry Men stared in amazement at this defiantly
impertinent Squirm.  Was his brain, never of
average power, softening at last?
</p>

<p>
"Cheeky little monkey," said Dick.  "You're not
of my House, or I'd give you the lamming of a lifetime.
Report yourself at once to Harwood for insolence.
I'll see him myself about you."
</p>

<p>
Quite unawed, cocksure of the weapon he held in
reserve, Peter coolly held his ground.
</p>

<p>
"No, you won't, Forge," he declared.  "You'll
either send Robin Arkness up the tree for my food, or
fetch it down yourself!"
</p>

<p>
So brazen an outrage to the dignity of a School
Captain could not be tolerated for a moment.
Forgetting Foxenby etiquette, which had no precedent
for a prefect of one House visiting summary justice on
a boy of another, Dick raised his hand to cuff Peter
soundly.  But the Squirm was too quick for him.
</p>

<p>
"Lay a finger on me, Forge, and I'll tell my father!
Yes, I will, and then he'll come straight to the school
and tell Old Wykeham how you cheated him out of
every penny of the money he spent on your rotten
<i>Rooke's House Rag</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Disgusting little vulgarian!  Full well he knew, and
vastly did he enjoy, the sensational effect of this
revelation amongst the Captain's stanchest
supporters.  They were clearly staggered by it; he could
see them exchanging quick and questioning glances,
and the success of his verbal boomerang emboldened
him still more.
</p>

<p>
"I will now have my biscuits and things, Forge, if
you please," he smilingly demanded.
</p>

<p>
Pale with suppressed emotion&mdash;anger and chagrin,
heart-sinking and mortification&mdash;Dick came then to
a deliberate decision.  Not as Captain of Foxenby,
but as plain Dick Forge, grossly insulted in public,
would he act.
</p>

<p>
"You will get what I give you, Mawdster," he
quietly said.  "And you're not likely to smack your
lips over it, either.  Turn round!"
</p>

<p>
"Shan't!  If you touch me, I'll tell my father!"
</p>

<p>
Dick beckoned then to Robin Hood, who ran
forward with alacrity.
</p>

<p>
"Arkness, just you and Flenton swing Mawdster
round and hold him tightly for a minute," he
ordered.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what a great day this was for Robin Hood and
his Merry Men!  Kicking and scratching and struggling
in vain, the stout and oily Squirm was manoeuvred
by Robin and Flenton into a position lending itself
admirably to corporal punishment.  Dick's stick,
selected from the sycamore, fell like a flail where it
would hurt the most and show the least.  For sixty
seconds or so he spared neither his strength nor Peter's
feelings.
</p>

<p>
Feverishly happy, the Merry Men skipped like
frolicsome lambs.  Here was rich entertainment indeed&mdash;the
Captain of Foxenby, in defiance of school traditions,
giving a slimy Squirm a first-class whacking in
the full glare of publicity!
</p>

<p>
Grimly finishing his task, Dick threw away the stick,
which one of the Merry Men fastened on as a souvenir
of the occasion.
</p>

<p>
"That will do.  Release him, you fellows.  Now,
Mawdster, will you go back to your House at once, or
shall I boot you there?"
</p>

<p>
Mawdster hobbled away, too genuinely sore for
noisy sobbing this time, but turning once to shake his
fist in ludicrous fury at the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"You'll pay for this, Forge.  Mark my words!" he
called back.
</p>

<p>
And Dick, as he marched away with his hands deep
in his trousers pockets, quite believed that he would
have to pay for this public vindication of his
dignity&mdash;pay to the bitter utmost in pitiless exposure and
disgrace.

CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
The Friend in Need
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"It is distinctly unusual to grant a special <i>exeat</i> so
early in the term, Forge," said Mr. Rooke, lifting his
eyebrows.  "Must you really go to Moston this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"That I should go is vital, sir, though I regret I
cannot tell you why."
</p>

<p>
"Rather awkward, though, Forge.  Cayton is still
away, and Lyon's rule-of-thumb methods do not
exactly make him an ideal deputy prefect.  Your
absence may annoy Mr. Wykeham.  Won't you take
an afternoon off next week instead?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to seem unreasonable, sir.  But, with or
without a special <i>exeat</i>, I must go to Moston to-day.
So you will see how serious the situation is."
</p>

<p>
The housemaster shrugged his shoulders resignedly.
"Well, Forge, if you put it like that, I suppose I must
sign," he said.  "Here's your <i>exeat</i>.  Don't be too
long away.  Discipline is getting rather slacker than I
like.  There was an appalling hubbub in the shrubbery
yesterday.  Luckily, Mr. and Mrs. Wykeham were out
to tea....  By the way, Forge, I'm sorry for the stoppage
of your sprightly little <i>Rag</i>.  It was doing the House
good.  May I help at all&mdash;can I do anything?"
</p>

<p>
Dick was touched by the kindly offer, and had his
difficulty been other than a financial one, he would have
gladly confided in Mr. Rooke.  But he knew the house-master
had no private means, and it would be embarrassing
to refuse any money that might be volunteered.
</p>

<p>
"You're awfully good, sir," he said, "and I may
take advantage of your kind offer if nothing comes of
my visit to Moston."
</p>

<p>
An hour later Dick had discovered Chuck
Smithies in a dark little office at the top of some very
steep stairs.  On the door was a small brass plate,
bearing the words "Smithies' Advance Bank and
Commission Agency".
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, sonny!  Got your eye back to its normal
colour, I see," was the bookmaker's cheery greeting.
"Wanting me particularly?"
</p>

<p>
"I want you badly," said Dick.  Then, having made
up his mind to take the plunge, he told Smithies the
full story of his editorial dilemma, and anxiously waited
to see what his sporting friend would say.
</p>

<p>
"Sonny," said Smithies, "you're in the clutches of
a dangerous man.  Mawdster's all 'butter' to your
face, all vinegar behind your back.  Chairman of
'Welfare' Societies, yet the most uncharitable
hypocrite you could meet in a month of Sundays.  Always
trying to worm himself in with the nobility and
gentry&mdash;you know the sort of viper I mean.  He'll give you
short shrift, lad, if you don't steal a march on him."
</p>

<p>
"But what can I do?" asked Dick, gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Pay his bill and have done with him."
</p>

<p>
"As easy as catching trout with a bent pin.  I
haven't the money."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  That's soon settled.  Wait there till I count
it out.  How much?  Shall we say ten or twenty
pounds?  We'll be on the safe side and call it thirty."
</p>

<p>
Dick sprang to his feet in evident concern.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, you know, this will never do.  I&mdash;I
didn't come here to cadge.  I wanted you to give me
your advice&mdash;not your money."
</p>

<p>
"Softly, softly, my young friend.  You've made me
count 'em wrong&mdash;I must begin again.  Who the
dickens said I was going to give you money?  This is
a business transaction, pure and simple.  I'm going to
lend you the cash to pay off that loathsome toady,
Aaron Mawdster.  You're just shifting your obligations,
lad, from a black man to a 'white' one."
</p>

<p>
"But I really can't accept your&mdash;your splendid
generosity," Dick managed to say.  He was almost
stupefied by the bookmaker's immediate and practical
response to his tale of woe.  "What guarantee have
you that I shall ever pay you back?  None whatever!"
</p>

<p>
"Lad, I prefer some people's honest faces to other
people's dishonest signatures.  I'll trust you with my
money&mdash;I'd trust you with my life.  Still, don't run
away with the idea that this is a favour I'm doing you.
It isn't.  You'll pay me five per cent on the money
when you return it, and that's more than I'd get on it
if it were lying idle in the bank.  Choose your own time
for repayment&mdash;I shan't miss that little lot for a year or
two.  Now, run off and get out of Mawdster's debt,
there's a dear lad.  I only wish I could come with you,
and see his ugly face drop when you pay him!"
</p>

<p>
Isn't it aggravating how completely words fail you
when you want most of all to be profuse in your
gratitude? Dick felt an absolute dummy as the bookmaker
forced the banknotes into his fingers and hustled him
downstairs.  This was the man whom, on his journey
from King's Cross, he had practically called a liar and
a thief!  This was the man whose methods of business
he had denounced with withering scorn&mdash;yet here he
stood, clutching a fistful of notes from Smithies' safe,
a party to one of those very transactions which he had
so emphatically condemned in the train!
</p>

<p>
"No, no, I can't take this money," he cried, making
a last fight against the temptation that was weakening
him.  "Do have it back, there's a good fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, youngster, stop rotting," fiercely replied
Mr. Smithies.  "I'm a bit of a boxer myself, let me
tell you, and, old as I am, I'll set about you and give
you worse than you gave Juddy Stockgill if you throw
that wretched packet o' money in my teeth again.  Are
we pals or aren't we?  Didn't we shake hands, like two
Britons, in the train?  And what good's a pal if he
won't get his hand down when his pard's in a deuce of
a mess? But it ain't a favour in any case&mdash;it's a
commercial transaction.  I've got a mortgage on your
honour, so to speak, and that's as safe as the Bank of
England!"
</p>

<p>
Again exhorting Dick to rush straight down to the
printer's with the cash, Smithies withdrew smartly into
his office and shut the door.  Dick heard the key
turning in the lock and the scraping of a chair as the
bookmaker resumed his seat.  He knocked hard and
obstinately, pleading for admission.
</p>

<p>
"Not in!" was the equally stubborn response.
"Come another day, sonny, and tell me how old
Mawdster takes the swipe you're going to give him!"
</p>

<p>
Out in the street, Dick looked at the notes he was
tightly holding, and placed them in his safest pocket.
That was an elementary precaution for a boy who had
lost so much loose cash before.  Then he turned
mechanically in the direction of the printing-office,
struggling at every step with his severely unyielding
conscience, which was all against his acceptance of the
favour, though his heart would fain have acquiesced
in it.
</p>

<p>
To be done with this load of debt which pressed so
heavily on his mind&mdash;to be free to sleep dreamlessly
again, to face the morrow with a head held high!  The
passport to such happiness was on his person&mdash;he had
only to sink his perverse pride, and he could be done
for ever with the manager of the Moston Cleartype
Press!
</p>

<p>
A waverer's mind can be made up for him, yea or
nay, by the accident of chance.  Thus was Dick's
indetermination brought to an end on this January
afternoon.  Stepping off the pavement irresolutely, he
bumped into the somewhat insignificant person of
Mr. Mawdster himself, and almost sent him sprawling into
the gutter.
</p>

<p>
"Clumsy fool, look where you're going!" snapped
the printer.  Then, noticing who had accidentally
buffeted him, he turned ironically polite, even to the
point of raising his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, bon soir, Mr. Forge, delighted to meet you, sir!
I fancy there is a little matter of business which awaits
settlement between us.  Is an agreement possible
before matters go too far?"
</p>

<p>
"It is quite possible, I think!" said Dick, coldly.
</p>

<p>
Aaron Mawdster gave him a sharp glance.  It was
difficult to reckon up this haughty schoolboy, whose
pride seemed unbendable.
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir; this way, if you please."
</p>

<p>
Dick followed the printer into his office, resolved now
to battle no longer against the inclination to be rid of
this man's veiled tyranny.  Better by far to owe money
to a friendly bookmaker than to a blackmailing enemy!
</p>

<p>
"Now, young man, I had a letter the other day from
my poor son, who still complains of vile ill-treatment
and lack of protection.  My heart bleeds for his
sufferings.  I am a kind and generous man, Mr. Forge, as
Moston people have good reason to know, but I can be
a ruthless foe when I choose."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," Dick commented, without moving a
muscle of his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know it, do you, Mr. Head-in-the-air!
Very well.  For positively the last time, do you intend
taking my misjudged and ill-used boy under your wing?"
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, Mr. Mawdster, I gave the impudent
young cub a well-earned thrashing with a stick
yesterday!"
</p>

<p>
Dick might have hurled a hand-grenade at the wall
with less effect than this calmly-blunt declaration
produced on the printer.  Aaron Mawdster's face passed
from its wonted pallor to an angry purple.
</p>

<p>
"You dared to strike my poor weak boy&mdash;you, twice
his size, beat him with a stick?"  A volley of oaths, in
the worst slang of a slum pothouse, relieved his feelings
here.  "Then, you great, hulking bully, I'll cast you
in the dust and trample on you!"
</p>

<p>
"Not literally, I suppose?" Dick said, with
contempt.  "Look here, Mr. Mawdster, when you've
quite emptied yourself of swear-words, you will oblige
me by naming the amount of my bill.  I want to pay it
and go!"
</p>

<p>
"Bluff!" scoffed the printer.  "Why should I waste
time making out a bill&mdash;what proof have I that you can
pay it?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  "'To Simple Simon said the Pieman,<br />
  First show me your penny',"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Dick quoted, with a laugh, which drew the printer into
a fresh outburst of abuse.  "So be it; here is the
money, Mr. Mawdster, in my hand.  Take a good look
at it."
</p>

<p>
It was the act of a novice in the game of commercial
poker to lay his cards on the table like that.  The
printer stared at the notes, and with rapid mental
arithmetic summed up their approximate value.  Then
he took full advantage of his opponent's youthful
inexperience.
</p>

<p>
"My account comes to thirty pounds, four shillings,
and sixpence," he said.  "Very reasonable, too,
allowing for the dearness of paper and labour."
</p>

<p>
A boy of shrewder business instincts&mdash;Roger Cayton,
for instance&mdash;would have haggled over that figure and
possibly secured some reduction.  But Dick, though
suspicious that he was being overcharged, made no
protest.  Out of his scanty store of pocket-money he
added four-and-sixpence to the notes Smithies had
lent him, and laid the full amount on the desk.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mawdster made for the cash as a greedy sparrow
darts down on crumbs of cake, but Dick quietly put his
school-cap over the little pile.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Mr. Mawdster, but I'll keep this
company till you bring the receipt," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Most insulting," snapped the printer.
</p>

<p>
"Yet most essential," retorted Dick.  "Fizz off,
Mr. Mawdster; I don't want to take root here!"
</p>

<p>
Considering how glibly he had arrived at the total
it seemed to take the manager of the Cleartype Press an
unusual time to arrange the items of the bill.  It filled
a quarto-memo, before he was satisfied with it, and
altogether looked a very imposing document.  But the
signature over the stamp was all Dick looked at or cared
about.
</p>

<p>
"That'll do," he said. "Good-bye to you, Mr. Mawdster."
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" cried the printer, still boiling hot.  "I
don't know where you got this money from&mdash;perhaps
I ought to enquire&mdash;but don't think you've washed out
all your obligations by it, my lad.  You have brazenly
confessed to beating my poorly son, and I know enough
about Foxenby's rules to imagine what a row you'll be
in when, to-morrow, I tell Mr. Wykeham of your illegal
brutality."
</p>

<p>
On all counts, this would have been a threat permitting
no possible repartee, as it was clearly undeniable
that Dick had taken the law into his own hands and
broken one of Foxenby's strictest regulations.  But
Dick had a brain-wave worthy of Roger&mdash;a happy
thought which made him feel almost proud of his
intuition.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Mawdster," he replied, "and <i>I</i>  know
sufficient of Moston's social rules to guess what
townspeople would think of you, the local paragon, 'the
granny white hen that never laid away', if they learnt
that you had taken advantage of a schoolboy's
misfortunes to try to blackmail him into showing favour
to your namby-pamby son.  If you come with any of
your sneaking tales to Foxenby to-morrow, I can find
ways and means of retaliating."
</p>

<p>
This sudden turning of the tables visibly upset the
printer.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you have the impertinence to libel me,
young feller," he snarled.  "I possess the unbounded
esteem of everybody in Moston."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite everybody, as I happen to know,"
retorted Dick, with kindly thoughts of "Chuck"
Smithies, whose estimate of Aaron Mawdster's
character had provided him with this verbal weapon.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what you say," spluttered the angry
printer.  "I shall come up to Foxenby to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sure you won't," cried Dick, putting a
bold face on his qualms.  "Good-bye, Mr. Mawdster.
I trust mine may be the pleasure of never seeing your
face again!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
Fluffy Jim provides a Sensation
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Moonlight mingled its rays with daylight as Dick
passed up the main street, his heart feeling "like a
flake of pure delight borne on an ocean wide".  He
ran along the pavement, not caring that there were no
coins in his pocket to jingle in harmony with his
movements.  How much better was an easy conscience than
a heavy purse!
</p>

<p>
Knowing that he ought now to get quickly back to
school, he was not too pleased to have a detaining hand
laid on his sleeve, and to find, on turning abruptly, the
grinning face of Fluffy Jim gazing amiably at him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try to stop me, Jim, there's a good chap," he
said.  "I'm in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"Um," said Fluffy Jim, "um."  But he still kept
his tight hold on Dick's sleeve.  Something seemed to
be on his mind, though he failed in language to express
it.
</p>

<p>
"Anything up, Jim?" queried Dick, impatiently.
"If so, get it off your chest.  I haven't a minute to
spare."
</p>

<p>
"Um," said Fluffy Jim again.  Then, removing
from his lips a short clay pipe, he pointed with it to the
moonlit hills.
</p>

<p>
"Want ter show thee summat," he said.  "Summat
funny, like."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you do," said Dick, with a laugh.  "But
I don't want to be shown&mdash;at least not at this end of the
day.  Try me when we meet again."
</p>

<p>
"Um," said Jim.  Yet he tugged hard and insistently
at Dick's sleeve, and there was in his cunning eyes
a depth of meaning that impressed Dick in spite of
himself.
</p>

<p>
A spirit of adventure seized the Captain of Foxenby,
and a moonlight visit to the hills, on that ideal evening,
did not lack attraction for him.  Still, he made one
more effort to disengage himself from Fluffy Jim's
grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Run away and play, Jim, that's a good boy," he
urged.  "Your penny show will wait awhile."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Jim, with quite convincing decision.
"Coom now!  Want to show thee summat!"
</p>

<p>
Curiosity got the upper hand of Dick.  He pushed
back from his mind the repressive thought of
Mr. Rooke, who had bidden him return early, and motioned
to Fluffy Jim to lead on.  There was something rather
whimsical in the idea of the Captain of Foxenby playing
truant, for all the world like a roving imp from the
Junior School!
</p>

<p>
Off set Fluffy Jim in high feather, making for the
moors as fast as he could pull one heavy hobnailed
boot after the other.  He looked an odd figure of
fun in the moonlight, but Dick knew better than to
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Jim, you did me out of a goal as clean
as a whistle in that cup final at Walsbridge," Dick took
the opportunity of reminding him.
</p>

<p>
"Um," grunted Jim.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you butt in? You robbed us of the cup,
Jim."
</p>

<p>
"Um."
</p>

<p>
"It's all very fine saying 'um', Jim, but 'um'
doesn't cut any ice.  Here, I say, tell me this&mdash;who put
you over the ropes and sent you across to kick the ball
from my toes?"
</p>

<p>
"If Ah telled <i>thee</i>, tha'd <i>know</i>," was the crafty
answer.  "And then," he added, unusually communicative,
"Ah'd ger a worse 'warmin'' fro' Ike Doccan
than Juddy an' his pals wor gi'ing me that day tha
stopped 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Ike Doccan!  Why, that's the porter and handyman
in Holbeck's House.  Did <i>he</i> tell you to do it,
Jim?"
</p>

<p>
But Fluffy Jim was quick enough to see that he had
gone too far in mentioning names.
</p>

<p>
"No, it worn't him.  Ah did it mesen, 'cos tha
couldn't scoöar.  Um!"
</p>

<p>
Nothing more would he say, despite all Dick's most
artful questioning, so that the subject had to be dropped.
But in the captain's mind a suspicion had been born.
He remembered now the frequency with which Ike
Doccan had joined the little group of Holbeck's House
Seniors in the days that preceded the final tie.  Not in
the least snobbish himself, he had nevertheless thought
it rather indiscreet, from the standpoint of discipline,
for the prefect of Holbeck's House to be seen fraternizing
with its porter, whose character for sobriety and
good manners was not above reproach.  He had,
indeed, been twice dismissed for drunkenness, and
twice reinstated because school porters were hard to
find.
</p>

<p>
"Now," thought Dick, "I wonder if that precious
gang were gambling on the match&mdash;betting against
Foxenby winning&mdash;and didn't <i>want</i> me to score?  By
Jove!  I recollect Smithies hinting in the train that
some of our chaps had made bets with him, but I
jumped down his throat about it.  I guess it'll soon
be my painful duty to have a talk with Luke Harwood
about this."
</p>

<p>
By this time they had reached the crest of the long
hill which led to the moors.  The early moon shone
clear upon the rough heathland path, along which Jim
silently plodded.
</p>

<p>
"What's your game, anyhow, Jim?  Strikes me
you've brought me all this way on a fool's errand."
</p>

<p>
"Want to show thee summat."
</p>

<p>
"'Summat', yes&mdash;but where is 'summat'?"
</p>

<p>
"In t'owd cottage.  Here 'tis.  Come inside."
</p>

<p>
With quickening interest, Dick followed the idiot
into the empty cottage, through the paneless casement
of which the moonlight streamed on a scene of
dilapidation.  The oven door of a rusty kitchen-stove
stood open, and in the corner was a tumbled pile of
abandoned tinware.  Condemned as unfit for habitation,
the cottage had obviously been left to fall asunder
in its own time.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jim, there's nothing here to write home
about," said Dick.  "Come, now, own up that you've
been making a fool of me, and let's get away."
</p>

<p>
"Ah'm not hevin' thee for t'mug," said Jim solemnly.
"There's summat here 'at'll please thee.  Ah fun it art
for mesen.  Noabody knows but me.  This ere floor
plays a tune.  Listen!"
</p>

<p>
He raised his heavily-booted feet with deliberation
and commenced a shuffling dance, grotesquely like the
performance of a captive bear.  And sure enough to
Dick's profound astonishment, the floor did play a tune
a jingle that, though harsh, was sufficiently musical
to wreathe the face of the idiot dancer in a delighted
grin.
</p>

<p>
"Ah telled thee&mdash;didn't Ah tell thee?" cried
Jim, in great excitement.  "Music!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'All around the mulberry bush,<br />
  Pop goes the weasel',"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he sang, kicking up his legs in ludicrous imitation of a
pierrot outside a travelling show.
</p>

<p>
"Here, slow down, Jim&mdash;that's enough!  Got any
matches in your pocket?  Good!  A stump of a candle,
too?  Better still!  Stick it in the neck of that old
beer-bottle&mdash;right-o!  Now, just you lean up against
the window to keep the draught off, while I make a
light.  Don't move from there, Jim.  I want to see
what's under these musical floor-boards of yours."
</p>

<p>
Shielding the flickering candle with his body, he
examined the boards, and immediately saw that they
had been fastened down with new nails.  They seemed
loose, but not loose enough to be prized up by his
pen-knife, the larger blade of which snapped off when he
tried his luck with it.
</p>

<p>
"Bother!" he exclaimed.  "The little blade's no
use.  Got a knife of any sort on you, Jim?"
</p>

<p>
Jim produced a huge clasp-knife, containing a blade
as strong as a file.
</p>

<p>
"T'coastguard gave me this," he chuckled.  "Ah
cuts me baccy wi' it.  Catch!"
</p>

<p>
Such an instrument was as good as a carpenter's tool
to Dick.  Speedily he had raised one of the boards, and
for the moment dropped it again in sheer astonishment,
so amazing was the discovery which his peering eyes
made.  In the light of the candle he had seen coins and
medals and bric-a-brac, jumbled hastily together as
though they had been poured there from a sack.
</p>

<p>
Quickly regaining his control, he forced up another
and yet another of the boards, with the revelation of
precious curios in each case.
</p>

<p>
"Jumping crackers!  Here we have the headmaster's
missing collection, or I'm a Dutchman.  Jim,
don't stand grinning there like an ape.  Come over
here and sit on these boards until I return.  I'm going
to Moston as fast as I can gallop, and I'll get back in
quick-sticks.  Don't you dare to move from here, Jim.
Smoke your pipe, and I'll buy you some more baccy
later on&mdash;packets of it.  You're sure you can stick it
here by yourself?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-176"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-176.jpg" alt="&quot;JIM, DON'T STAND THERE GRINNING LIKE AN APE&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;JIM, DON'T STAND THERE GRINNING LIKE AN APE&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Um," said Jim, settling down on the boards like a
contented hen covering chickens.
</p>

<p>
Still apprehensive, Dick uttered a final caution&mdash;perhaps
more effective than his previous warning.
</p>

<p>
"If you do leave here, Jim, I'll lam you when next I
catch you."
</p>

<p>
"Um," said Jim, evidently impressed.
</p>

<p>
He proved a faithful custodian, being still there,
squatting in a cloud of rank tobacco-smoke, when Dick
returned with an inspector and two constables, who
proceeded solemnly to lift out the curios one by one,
and by the light of their lanterns to make a careful note
of each.
</p>

<p>
"I call this a funeral," said Dick.  "Can't we
bundle them all in the bags and get off to Foxenby?
You're cheating Old Man Wykeham out of hours of joy
by this game!"
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Mr. Forge, but it must be done," said the
inspector.  "If the head-master misses anything that
ought to be here, he'll know the burglars are to blame.
Us police has to be particular.  We has nasty things
said about us sometimes."
</p>

<p>
In consequence of all this ceremony the moon had
climbed much higher before the little party, having left
a policeman to watch the cottage, moved laboriously
down the hillside in the direction of Moston.  Here a
formal call had to be made at the police-station to
report the thrilling discovery, after which a swift
motor-car took Dick and the inspector up to the school.
</p>

<p>
The head-master had just risen from a frugal dinner,
and was again engaged upon a task which had hitherto
baffled his intensest efforts&mdash;that of piecing together
in manuscript the descriptive details of the precious
curios which had for so many weeks been missing.
</p>

<p>
So deeply engrossed was he in this exacting memory
test that even the announcement of the inspector's
coming conveyed little to his mind.  Therefore, when
the inspector and Dick came in, each bearing a heavy
bag, he gazed at them with a lack-lustre eye, as though
he imagined them to be commercial travellers arriving
with samples of school books.
</p>

<p>
The inspector saluted.  "Your missing property
sir," he said.  "Will you examine it, please, and
compare it with the list made by me on the spot?"
</p>

<p>
Crash went the head-master's chair on the floor, and
down amongst his manuscript went his glasses.  With
an almost juvenile bound he reached the bags, satisfied
himself at a glance that the recovery was indeed
genuine, and then turned to wring the inspector's hand
effusively.
</p>

<p>
The inspector backed away as though he feared being
kissed next.
</p>

<p>
"Don't thank me, sir; you owe it all to Mr. Forge
here.  It was he who put us on the right track."
</p>

<p>
In official phrases he gave the Head particulars of the
discovery, with results that embarrassed Dick, who had
never quite "hit it" with "Old Man Wykeham", and
was always more or less ill-at-ease in his presence.  This
was not surprising, seeing that everybody knew the
Head would have preferred Luke Harwood as Captain
of the School.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand thanks, Forge!  Oh, bless my soul,
boy, where's my handkerchief&mdash;I must dab my eyes&mdash;I
verily believe I am shedding tears of joy, Inspector.
Forge, dear lad&mdash;I'm the happiest man in England
to-day.  All my precious curios are here, and with
scarcely a scratch on them.  What could have
possessed the burglars to dump them down under the floor
of that disused cottage?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably their pockets would be stuffed with
stolen silver and notes, sir," the inspector suggested,
"and, finding us hot on their trail, they decided to hide
your coins and things till the hue and cry had died
down.  They'll come nosing back for 'em, sir, as sure
as fate.  Then we shall nab them, as we mean to leave
officers concealed there day and night."
</p>

<p>
"It is all very exciting&mdash;I feel mentally upside down.
Dear me, how very ungrateful you will think me, too.
I was forgetting the reward.  For the recovery of my
collection I offered fifty pounds&mdash;a mere bagatelle
compared with their value to me.  Priceless treasures!
My Charles the First slip-top spoons in particular&mdash;I
fretted badly over those, and here they are, safe and
sound.  Forge, the reward is yours, and right well
deserved, too.  Take a seat, dear boy, while I write
out your cheque."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, sir, nothing of the kind!" Dick hastened
to say.  "If the reward must be paid, it should go to
Fluffy Jim, the half-witted village youth.  But for him,
the collection might not have been found.  He took
me straight to it."
</p>

<p>
"That's true, Mr. Wykeham," interposed the
inspector; "but Daft Jim would never have thought of
taking up the floor-boards.  He was merely amusing
himself with the music, as he called it.  The credit is
really Mr. Forge's, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You have all acted splendidly," the Head said.
"There is no need at all for splitting hairs.  I am fairly
well-to-do, Inspector, as you doubtless know, and the
total loss of my invaluable collection would have
blighted the hopes of a lifetime.  Forge shall have his
fifty pounds (silence, my boy&mdash;I insist!), you and your
staff shall hear from me later, Inspector, and Jim's
parents shall receive a sufficient recognition of his
services to enable them to purchase warm clothing and
substantial comforts for him.
</p>

<p>
"It is," he added, after a pause, "the very least I
can do in grateful acknowledgment of my amazing
good fortune.  I am only sorry that I alone should have
benefited, and that nobody else's property appears to
have been recovered.  That's particularly hard lines
on you, Forge, who lost so much in cash.  May I hope
that you will now resume the publication of your bright
little house magazine?"
</p>

<p>
Dick looked hard at the cheque in his hand.  It
seemed as though he were playing a part in a stage
play&mdash;that he would awake to find it a dream.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to start the <i>Rag</i> again, sir, but better
luck will be needed next time."
</p>

<p>
The Head laughed joyously.  "No more burglaries
here, I trust!  You'll see to that, won't you, Inspector?
And Forge, remember this, if ever you get into
difficulties again, be more confiding about them and come
to me.  I think I can promise you that the <i>Rooke's
House Rag</i> will never again cease publication for lack
of funds."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
Roger returns to Brighter Skies
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Immediately after breakfast the Head called the boys
together in the hall and gave them a graphic account of
the recovery of his collection, praising the blushing
captain sky-high.  Then he gave the school a holiday,
and topped it by declaring that "some very special
dainties" would be provided for supper that night.
</p>

<p>
It was a red-letter day all round.  Robin Hood and
his Merry Men held high revelry in the Forest, and
even called a truce with the Squirms so that there
might be no shadow on the day's sunshine.
</p>

<p>
They were not tempted from grace, either, by the
red-rag irritation of Peter Mawdster's presence.  That
sick and sorry youth took advantage of the holiday to
slip down home, and, for some reason never publicly
explained, he was seen at Foxenby no more.  Possibly
his doting parents decided to remove him to a less
robust and more genteel atmosphere than that which
Foxenby afforded.  Anyhow, his disappearance had no
more effect on the school than the swift death of a
midge in a summer thunderstorm.
</p>

<p>
Dick took his fifty-pound cheque to the head-master's
bank and withdrew thirty-five pounds of it, leaving the
remainder on deposit in his own name.  Then he
hunted up "Chuck" Smithies, who was amusing himself
by turning over a portfolio of old sporting prints.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, sonny!  Come to tell me how you ticked off
that jelly-fish, Aaron Mawdster, yesterday afternoon?
I can see by your face that you wrung the low-down
animal's withers for him!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks to you, I metaphorically mopped him up,"
said Dick.
</p>

<p>
The bookmaker roared with laughter over Dick's
unvarnished account of the printing-office interview,
in which the captain had seen nothing particularly
funny at the time.
</p>

<p>
"You rattled the hypocrite's teeth with a rasping
upper-cut there, lad," said Smithies.  "Oh, I'll laugh
till I cry!  Threatening to expose him as a blackmailer
got right through his sanctimonious guard.  He'd
dread that.  You could have bowled him out with it,
whether you'd paid him or not."
</p>

<p>
"I paid him, though.  He took all you lent me and
some odd shillings besides."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly what he would do, the dirty blighter!  But
here, I say, what are you trying on, youngster?
Repaying me already?"  He stared almost resentfully at
the thirty-five pounds which Dick laid before him.
"Been picking paper-money off trees, kid, or what is
it? Pardon me if I seem dazed, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Please take it, Smithies.  I'd the luck of a lifetime
yesterday."  Briefly Dick described his moonlit trip to
the hills with Fluffy Jim, and what came of it.  "So,
you see, I can repay your kind loan with a balance in
hand."
</p>

<p>
What seemed distinctly like a shade of annoyance
crossed the bookmaker's face.  "Sonny, we parted on
good terms yesterday&mdash;don't strew tacks under the
wheel of friendship to-day.  Am I Shylock, that you
should plunk down a fiver for a day's interest on thirty
pounds?  I'll take back what I lent you and not a penny
more."
</p>

<p>
Dick felt rather foolish.  "But you said it was a
business transaction," he replied, defensively.  "I'm
most awfully sorry if I've unwittingly hurt your
feelings&mdash;do please forgive me for being such a clown.  I&mdash;I
only thought it would be rather nice to make you a
little friendly acknowledgment of your great kindness."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've put it on the wrong footing, youngster,
that's all.  'Business transaction' was my camouflage
for it.  Just a loan to oblige a pal&mdash;which it did, thank
goodness, in putting you top-side of Aaron Mawdster
yesterday.  There, now, take no notice of my bluster&mdash;I'm
only kidding.  Take back your fiver and give me
instead a little souvenir of the occasion&mdash;one I rather
fancy."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever it is, it's yours, Smithies," Dick eagerly
agreed.
</p>

<p>
"A photograph of yourself in football togs&mdash;this
size&mdash;to fit into my portfolio of sporting cracks."
</p>

<p>
"The honour's mine there," said Dick.  He
bethought himself of Robin Arkness's autograph-book,
and smiled.  "You're putting me early into the
gallery of Fame!  I hate being photographed, Smithies,
but you shall have the picture.  Mr. Rooke will take
it&mdash;he's a wizard with a camera."
</p>

<p>
"That'll suit me down to the ground, sonny.  It'll
be a nice memento to put beside a photograph of the
football cup, which you're sure to win next time.
</p>

<p>
"For," added the bookmaker inwardly, as Dick left
the office, "I'm taking no bets on that replay from Ike
Doccan's dirty paw.  If he wasn't acting for a few
schoolboys who meant Foxenby no good, I'll eat my
go-to-meeting suit of clothes."
</p>

<p>
Dick had swung happily half-way back to school
when he observed Robin Arkness running towards him
breathlessly.  The Junior waved at him an
orange-coloured envelope.
</p>

<p>
"A telegram for you, Forge," he announced.  "I
saw you come down here, so I risked bringing it along."
</p>

<p>
"Jolly decent of you, youngster&mdash;thanks," said Dick,
trying to behave as though telegrams were an everyday
event with him, though his pulse was rapid as he opened
the envelope and read its contents.
</p>

<p>
"Kid, what splendid news you've brought me!
Cayton is coming back to school by the midday train,
and wants me to meet him.  We've just time to
celebrate it.  Come and have a lemonade or something."
</p>

<p>
The "something" spread itself out into quite a
classy midday feed for Robin, who, having done
himself proud at the smiling captain's expense, hurried
back to school to scatter envy among his less fortunate
comrades.  It was then time for the train, which
brought with it a paler but much-happier-looking
Roger than the anxious prefect who left Foxenby in
December.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Roger, old boy," said Dick, when they had
treated themselves to a very fervent handshake, "I
expected to see you a limping crock, looking justifiably
sorry for yourself, yet you're laughing all across your
face and half-way down your back.  Does being
feverishly ill buck a chap up so much as all that?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Dick, I meant to keep it dark till we were
locked in our study to-night, but I simply can't hold
it in.  It's ripping tidings I've got for you&mdash;top-hole!"
</p>

<p>
"Judging by your beaming countenance, it must be."
</p>

<p>
"Laddie, it's great!  I'm no longer a 'deadhead',
financially speaking, in the <i>Rooke's House Rag</i> partnership.
I can go shares in the cost, whatever it is.  I've
made money&mdash;I'm a professional author!"
</p>

<p>
"No, never!  Get away with your nonsense, Roger!"
</p>

<p>
"It's sober truth, old Doubting Thomas.  I've a
savings-bank book in my pocket, showing that twenty
guineas is standing to my credit.  And every penny of
that was made by writing&mdash;I've the proofs of the series
of sketches in my pocket, and you and I are going to
correct them together to-night!"
</p>

<p>
He had an enraptured and admiring auditor in Dick
as he explained how, determined to do his bit towards
making good the loss of the <i>Rag's</i> subscription-money,
he had conceived the idea of writing a dialect sketch
descriptive of the quaint customs and mannerisms of
his own village.  By great good fortune the simple
humour of it had caught the fancy of the first editor
to whom he offered it.  "Send me eleven more brief
sketches in the same vein," wrote the editor, "and
I'll pay you twenty guineas for the dozen."
</p>

<p>
It was, Roger admitted, a staggering commission, and
ultimately it overweighted him.  What with tramping
about in search of "local colour" in the daytime, and
then sitting up secretly at nights in order to transfer
his thoughts to paper, he broke down, and only just
finished the job in time&mdash;indeed, he had no recollection
of actually posting the series, and was only certain he
had done so when, a few days before returning to
school, he had received the promised cheque in payment.
</p>

<p>
"There was absolutely nothing in them, old chap&mdash;the
simplest stuff you could imagine.  I said as much
to the editor-chap, who replied that their simplicity
was their charm.  I just jotted down the fairy-stories
of the district, and described the funny folk who told
them, and it clicked."
</p>

<p>
"You're a wise old bird, Roger," said Dick, almost
worshipping this revelation of his chum's intellect.
"I shall put a special paragraph in the new <i>Rag</i> about
all this&mdash;yes, I shall&mdash;I'm editor-in-chief, so you can't
stop me.  Now, it's <i>your</i> turn to listen to <i>me</i>, and I
think my tale about even beats yours, old lad!"
</p>

<p>
An opinion which Roger emphatically confirmed
when, despite many excited interruptions from him,
Dick had completed the yarn.
</p>

<p>
"Great!" commented Roger.  "A thrill from beginning
to end.  Isn't it strange how things work out?
Grand bit of compensation that Fluffy Jim, after
spoiling your goal, should put that fifty-pound reward
right under your nose.  Rough gratitude for your
services in snatching him from Juddy Stockgill's
clutches, though he only meant to show you his
'cottage musical-box'."
</p>

<p>
They spent a happy afternoon in their study,
exchanging confidences over the fire concerning almost
everything that had happened during their enforced
separation.  One thing, and one thing only, did Dick
keep from Roger, and that was his suspicion that Luke
Harwood had had some hand in messing up the final
tie.  He wanted to bring an unprejudiced mind to
that subject when he discussed it with Luke, which he
fully intended to do at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
By dusk Roger knew nearly as much about Foxenby's
affairs as if illness had not kept him away.  He was
sympathetic about the misfortune that had overtaken
Dick's aunt, but rather thought that he would
personally be able to make up for any loss of pocket-money
in that direction by writing more sketches for the Press.
Which shows how little success is needed to make an
amateur author vain.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Rag</i> must come out again," he said, "and that
right speedily.  The firm that prints the <i>Foxonian</i>
shall do it for us this time&mdash;they're clean and above
reproach."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Dick.  "I'm game.  In an
hour the fellows will be trooping in to supper which
the Old Man is making a toothsome event to-night.  On
their way they'll pass the notice-board."
</p>

<p>
And thus it happened that, after a happy day of
unexpected liberty, the Foxes were able to read more
sympathetically than they would have done a day or
two before, the following intimation on the hall
notice-board:&mdash;
</p>

CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
The Tourist who talked Poetry
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the matter of freedom from irksome boundaries
Foxenby was a school to be envied.
</p>

<p>
Moston, certainly, could not be visited at any time
without permission, nor were the boys allowed to
roam the rocky and dangerous seashore at their own
sweet will; but to the north-west of the school there
were great stretches of kindly moorland over which
they could wander without coming to any harm, and
they were given every chance to imbibe the ozone of
the hills at week-ends and on holidays.
</p>

<p>
Shrove Tuesday, with its generous supply of pancakes,
usually tended towards languor, and most of the
Squirms remained indoors to sleep off their too-liberal
helpings.  The sound of their snoring, as they sprawled
about on the furniture of the common-room, disgusted
Robin Arkness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, my Merry Men, we can't stick this," he
said.  "Hear how the pigs grunt."
</p>

<p>
"It's like being in a farm-yard," remarked Flenton.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we stir the porkers up with our trusty
cross-bows&mdash;yclept, these pea-shooters&mdash;and then engage
them in mortal combat? Nay, in this sottish state they
are not worthy foemen.  Right about turn, boys.  We
will hie us up yonder hills for an afternoon's ramble."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, good Robin," the Merry Men readily agreed.
</p>

<p>
It was a clear, frosty day, and even the bright sun
shine did little to neutralize the sharp nip in the air.
It meant moving briskly to keep the blood in circulation;
the higher they climbed, the keener blew the breeze.
</p>

<p>
"Ripping way to get warm, doing the 'Excelsior'
stunt up this hillside," said Robin enthusiastically.
"See that cottage in front of the fir trees, Men?  That's
where Forge found Old Man Wykeham's valuables."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, let's have a squint inside it," Little John
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Softly, my faithful henchman!  Dost thou not
know that this self-same cottage is guarded, night and
day, by the myrmidons of the law?"
</p>

<p>
"But the coppers won't interfere with us.  They
know we're all from Foxenby, and mean no harm.
Come on!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay hold!  Thou art my right-hand man, Little
John, and many a time and oft have I had cause to be
thankful for the doughty assistance of thy strong right
arm.  But methinks thou art far from possessing the
wisdom of a Socrates."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, call me a blinking ass and have done with
it," said Flenton, rather ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"No offence, my trusty bowman.  Canst thou not
see, however, that to enter the cottage boldly will be
to bring down on our helpless heads the wrath of the
police? They are not in the cottage itself, but hidden
amongst the gorse-bushes, ready to pounce on the
thieves if they venture inside."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pot it, must we go back then?"
</p>

<p>
"Perish the thought!  Never let it be said that
Robin Hood and his Merry Men turned their backs on
any peril, however dire.  We will creep round them
with stealthy, noiseless tread, and see if the varlets are
doing their duty as nobly as they should, or, like the
greedy Squirms, merely sleeping off the effects of pancakes."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion, though not so much to the Merry
Men's liking as Flenton's projected exploration of the
cottage, nevertheless held promise of a little mild
adventure, and they acted on it.  Creeping from bush
to bush with scarcely a sound, they came at last in sight
of two plain-clothes policemen, dressed as builder's
labourers, sitting on some dried bracken-leaves, and
looking anything but gay.
</p>

<p>
Probably they had been forbidden to speak, for they
were conversing rather guiltily in low tones, the burden
of their complaint being that though they had pipes
and tobacco in their pockets they dared not light them.
</p>

<p>
"This is a daft and perishin' job," said one of them.
"I'd like to wring the neck of Fluffy Jim for stumbling
across them pewter pots and coins."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, that's ungrateful," retorted his mate.  "We
each got a quid of Old Wykeham's money out of the job."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  It'll cost me more than any quid to sweat
this cold out of my bones.  My teeth chatter like a
baboon's.  Got a drop or two left in your flask, Sam?"
</p>

<p>
"Drained it dry half-an-hour since, Bill."
</p>

<p>
"And it'll be two more floggin' hours afore we're
relieved from duty.  I'm fed up.  I'll resign from the
Force, pension or no pension, and take to navvyin'."
</p>

<p>
"No use, Bill.  Once a policeman, always a policeman.
It's in the blood."
</p>

<p>
"There's nowt i' my blood just now but icicles,
Sam.  Where's the use of this night-and-day vigil,
anyhow? Although the recovery of the treasure was
kept out of the newspapers, it's quite likely the
cracksmen will have got wind of it by this, and won't come
near."
</p>

<p>
"Won't they!  I reckon they will.  What troubles
me is how they're goin' to be nabbed when they do.
It'll be two policemen against four thieves, mebbe, and
they're sure to have the latest thing in quick-firing
revolvers."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, drop that!  You make me creepy, Sam, all
up t'spine.  I've got a wife and childer, and don't want
to die just yet."
</p>

<p>
"Might be better to be shot dead than to peg out o'
frost-bite, anyhow.  Here, I say, Bill, have a glance
down the hill&mdash;careful, now!  Who's this
queer-looking image crawling up towards us?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, only one o' them tourist cranks that walks
round here in all weathers.  Got half-a-vanful of tin
mugs and spare socks strapped on his back, you'll
notice.  Loads himself up like a pack-horse and calls
it sport."
</p>

<p>
"He's waddlin' this way.  What shall we do if he
stops to talk?"
</p>

<p>
"Talk back, of course; anything for a change."
</p>

<p>
The perspiring tourist dropped his stick at the sight
of the two men and started back nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" he exclaimed.  "Pardon me&mdash;I didn't
notice you.  Like me, you are lovers of Nature, and are
drinking the sweet nectar of this gorgeous hill-air into
your lungs."
</p>

<p>
Both the plain-clothes men looked as if they'd much
prefer to be drinking beer, but they grunted by way of
reply.  Unabashed, the tourist unstrapped his knapsack,
and sat upon it.  Then he wiped his brow on a
dingy red handkerchief, and stroked an iron-grey beard
as he gazed dreamily towards the sea.
</p>

<p>
"I was told that I must on no account miss the view
from the top of the hill&mdash;the grandest aspect on the
East Coast," he said.  "It is, indeed, a joy to look
upon it.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle....<br />
  This precious stone set in the silver sea',<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
as Shakespeare truly says.  Ah, what a rich and rare
delight it is to be alive on such a day as this!"
</p>

<p>
Sam touched his forehead significantly as he looked
at Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Barmy!" Bill's answering glance seemed to say.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  New life courses through my all-too-sluggish
veins to-day.  For ever have I done with the softening
influence of the fireside.

<p class="noindent">
What do you say, friends? Surely you realize the
great boon that is yours in being able to spend so much
of your lives in such an enchanted spot?"
</p>

<p>
This was rubbing it in with a vengeance, and Bill
could keep silence no longer.
</p>

<p>
"You can cart the bloomin' landscape away with you,
if you like, sir," he said.  "We're dead sick of bein'
anchored to it."
</p>

<p>
"God bless my soul!  Just think of that!" cried the
tourist.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Breathes there a man with soul so dead<br />
  Who never to himself hath said,<br />

</p>

<p class="noindent">
Good fellows, you take my breath away.  You have
made me feel the need of refreshment.  With your
indulgence, I will consume a sandwich."
</p>

<p>
He produced a packet of sandwiches, extracted one
and demolished it with evident relish, quoting poetry
all the time about the beauties of meat and drink.  Two
more sandwiches followed the first, and then,
unscrewing the top of a flask, he set it to his lips and
drank.
</p>

<p>
And what a thirst he had.  What ample accommodation
for liquor!  Not once did he remove the flask
from his mouth until the contents had gurgled down his
throat.  Even then he seemed reluctant to admit that
he had drained the last drop, for he glanced into the
recesses of the flask with a wistful and still-thirsty
eye.
</p>

<p>
"Greedy beggar!" muttered Bill to Sam.  "Never
even offered us a 'wet', and us half-frozen to death!"
</p>

<p>
Whether the tourist heard this whispered comment
or not was problematical, but he seemed suddenly to
become aware that two pairs of eyes were fixed upon
him yearningly.  He jumped up with an apologetic air.
</p>

<p>
"Please forgive me," he said.  "Really, you will
think me most impolite.  Permit me to offer you a
sandwich each.  Nay, take two apiece.  Don't be
afraid of them; they won't bite you."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll bite them, thankee, sir," said Sam,
proceeding to find the sandwiches a good home within his
hungry anatomy.
</p>

<p>
Between them, the plain-clothes men, urged to do
so by the tourist, polished off the sandwiches.  Then
they drew the backs of their hands across their mouths
and sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Satisfied?" queried the tourist, laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"Never enjoyed a bit o' grub so much in my life,"
said Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Ditto," said Sam.  "If any fault could be found,
there was a bit too much salt in 'em.  Conducive to
thirst rather."
</p>

<p>
"Now, isn't that vexing?" said the tourist.  "If only
I had thought of you before emptying the flask!  There
isn't a house of refreshment within miles."
</p>

<p>
"We couldn't go to it if there was," Bill began, and
then bit his lip as Sam violently nudged him to be
silent.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I have it!" the tourist cried.  "Wait a moment
till I unstrap my knapsack.  I have a little flask in
there which I keep in reserve.  It contains some
rather fine old cognac&mdash;an excellent pick-me-up.  If I
might offer you a draught of that&mdash;but perhaps you are
teetotal?"
</p>

<p>
"Not on your dreamy eyes," said Bill, with unconcealed
eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be glad of a wee reviver, thankee, sir," said
the more tactful Sam.  "It's a cold job waiting here
for the&mdash;for the boss."
</p>

<p>
"You're very truly welcome, gentlemen."  So
saying, the tourist half-filled the top of the empty flask
with some of the contents of the smaller one.  "Which
of you drinks first?"
</p>

<p>
Bill's impoliter hand stretched farthest, and it was
he who first had the delight of smacking his lips over
the spirit.  Excellent it must have been, for his
countenance glowed.
</p>

<p>
"Fit for a king, guv'nor," he pronounced it.  "It's
gingered up every nook and cranny of me."
</p>

<p>
"Powerful stuff, certainly," the tourist agreed.  "I
only touch it now and again, when feeling rather fagged.
Your turn now, my friend."
</p>

<p>
Sam, more studious of the correct manner, sipped his
cognac appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
"Better stuff than that never warmed the cockles of
a man's heart, sir," he said.  "I'm main obliged to
you, for sure."
</p>

<p>
The tourist gazed into his flask with a measuring eye.
</p>

<p>
"I think I might safely spare another wee drappie,"
he said.  "Feel like another drain, either of you?"
</p>

<p>
They both declared they did&mdash;Bill with emphasis,
Sam with faint reluctance.
</p>

<p>
The tourist obliged them.  Then, conveniently blind
to the doglike pleading of Bill's enamoured eye, he
screwed up the flask and returned it to his knapsack.
</p>

<p>
"Gives me a Good Samaritan-like feeling to see you
both so refreshed," he said.  "I must be getting
farther on now, though I could stay till sunset in the
enraptured contemplation of this ideal view.  How
sweetly the moon and stars will rise o'er yonder sea.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of Heaven<br />
  Blossomed the lovely stars,'"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he quoted, with many theatrical gestures.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to know a wonderful lot of poetry, sir,"
said Sam, with the inward reservation that this generous
stranger was certainly something of a harmless lunatic.
</p>

<p>
"I could speak verse to you for hours, friend&mdash;beautiful
stuff from all the greatest poets, living and
dead.  Will it interest you at all if I recite a page or
two from Homer's <i>Iliad</i> or from Byron's <i>Childe
Harold</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Both Sam and Bill would have preferred a page or
two from a sporting paper, but the rich spirit, so
unfamiliar to their palates, had made them amiably
disposed towards the eccentric tourist, and quite ready to
humour his whims.
</p>

<p>
"Give it mouth, guv'nor," said Bill, settling himself
down in the dried bracken again.
</p>

<p>
"Fire away, sir," said Sam.
</p>

<p>
And "fire away" the stranger did, spouting yards of
rigmarole which the two plain-clothes men tried in
vain to follow.  To them, it was duller even than the
prosiest magisterial speeches they had ever heard in
Court.  It made them sleepy; they could scarcely
refrain from yawning in his face.
</p>

<p>
Bill kept closing his eyes, and each time he remembered
himself it took a still greater effort to open them
again.  Sam, too, grew drowsier and drowsier.  The
sound of the reciter's voice appeared to become muffled
and distant; was he wound up for the day&mdash;would he
never stop?
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, guv'nor," Bill protested at last.
"Had&mdash;'bout 'nuff of it.  Can't keep awake&mdash;if you go
on&mdash;much&mdash;longer."
</p>

<p>
"'Ear, 'ear, Bill," murmured Sam, forgetting to be
polite.  "Them's my&mdash;sentiments&mdash;'xactly."
</p>

<p>
"Old gasbag, I&mdash;calls&mdash;him," grunted Bill.
</p>

<p>
Those were the last words either of them spoke that
afternoon.  Rolling over, almost simultaneously, on
the bracken, they lay there in a stupor, breathing
heavily, lost to all about them, deaf at last to the droning
tones of the reciter.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  They've dropped off," said the tourist.
His voice held no hint of wounded pride&mdash;rather did
it seem eloquent of satisfaction.  He leaned over the
sleepers and shook them violently in turn.  Their heads
waggled to and fro, but neither took any heed.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely doped," the stranger muttered.
"Given them an over-dose, perhaps, but that can't
be helped.  Now for the rest of the performance."
</p>

<p>
Moving now with remarkable speed for so elderly-looking
a man, he drew from his knapsack a couple of
flags, one red, one white, and ran with them to the very
crest of the hill.  Then he made some rapid signals,
waited half-a-minute as though for an answer, and
semaphored again.  Apparently satisfied, he returned
to the spot where the two plain-clothes policemen
snored, and stood over them, watch in hand.
</p>

<p>
"The car will be up in two minutes," he said, softly.
"Bravo, Cyrus the Poet!  Thou hast done thy work
well."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
The Merry Men win Glory
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mice could have been little quieter than Robin Hood
and his Merry Men during the whole of the passages
between the two plain-clothes policemen and the
talkative stranger.
</p>

<p>
Almost bursting with mirth at first, they followed
Robin's example by stuffing their handkerchiefs into
their mouths to stifle their laughter.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the afternoon was cold for crouching
about amongst bushes did not concern them&mdash;they had
watched football on much colder days.  What was an
occasional shiver compared with such undiluted
amusement as this?  How glad they were then that they had
taken Robin's advice to conceal themselves, instead of
blundering into the empty cottage at Little John's
fatheaded suggestion.
</p>

<p>
Later, agog with excitement, they had something to
do to hold their tongues, as it became evident to most
of them that the stranger was playing a dirty trick on
the two disguised policemen.  Robin got out of his
pocket a scrap of paper and wrote on it the one word
"drugged".  This was passed from hand to hand,
and all the Merry Men nodded in agreement.
</p>

<p>
There was need of his strong and quick leadership,
too, when the stranger's flag-signalling began.
Again using paper as an agent, Robin pencilled a few
directions to Flenton, who handed the slip to the three
other boys mentioned on it.  He and this trio were the
sturdiest runners in the Junior school, and their
instructions were to steal quietly off by the Bramble Path,
known to the Foxes as the easiest descent other than
the roadway, and, while taking care not to be seen,
reach the police-station as speedily as possible and
inform the Chief Constable of the strange things that
were happening.  The Bramble Path was a narrow
sunken track that wound steeply down the hillside
through closely-growing brambles and bushes.  It
afforded a first-rate hidden escape from the neighbourhood
of the cottage for the Foxes, who were not without
practice in the art of moving silently and taking
advantage of cover.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Robin did some furious thinking.  He
calculated the chances of a successful attack upon the
sham tourist, but abandoned that idea as melodramatic,
not to say dangerous.  Moreover, he had been near
enough to overhear what the stranger said about the
swift coming of a car, and where, he reflected, would
be the sense of tackling one offender, when there might
be three or four others in league with him?
</p>

<p>
Robin had the gumption to see that a battle with
grown men, most probably armed, on this lonely
moorland, would be a very different thing indeed
from a wild rough-and-tumble with the Squirms in
Foxenby's Forest.  This was no cinema rehearsal, but
a grimly realistic piece of business, with which no
Fourth Form schoolboys had the strength to grapple.
Whatever was done, therefore, must be accomplished
by silent strategy.
</p>

<p>
Motioning the Merry Men to remain quietly in their
somewhat cramped positions, he waited with fast-beating
heart until the throbbing of a motor-engine
indicated that the expected car was climbing the hill.
Half-a-minute later the car drew up, and two small,
thick-set men, each carrying what appeared to be
ordinary travelling-bags, hurriedly joined the
verse-reciting stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Why the deuce did you keep us waiting so long?"
irritably inquired one of them.  "Wasn't the coast
clear?"
</p>

<p>
The "tourist" pointed to the two drugged men on
the ground.
</p>

<p>
"I stumbled across this typical pair of British
working-men sitting here as though they'd taken
root&mdash;waiting for their boss to come, they said.
Probably they were going to start pulling the cottage down.
I had to win their confidence and dope them, as you
see.  Of course, it took time."
</p>

<p>
"Bully for you, Cyrus!" was the admiring admission.
"You're sure they're safe?"
</p>

<p>
"Try them.  See this."
</p>

<p>
The poet turned one of the policemen half over and
let him roll back with a thud.  The drugged man
snored on.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  Now let's hurry up with the job
before their boss does come, what?"
</p>

<p>
They all three disappeared into the cottage.
</p>

<p>
Robin wasted not a moment.  Already, by means of
another slip of paper, he had arranged with Dave what
to do.  As swiftly as they dared the pair ran to the
waiting and unattended motor-car.  Each had his
penknife ready.  Robin selected a front wheel and
Dave a back one.  Rapidly they plunged their knives
up to the hilt a few times into the tyres.
</p>

<p>
"That'll settle 'em," whispered Robin, triumphantly.
"Now, let's have all the Merry Men creep farther back
from the danger-zone.  We've got to see this thing
through."
</p>

<p>
A few of the less-adventurous spirits "got the wind
up" and made off down the Bramble Path, but Robin
was not sorry to see them go, particularly as they were
careful to make no noise.  In the last resource, if the
security of the remainder were threatened, they, too,
could make themselves scarce by the same convenient
route.
</p>

<p>
Barely another minute had elapsed before a medley
of very hard swearing proceeded from the interior of
the cottage.  It had not taken long to wrench up the
boards, which the police had nailed down again after
forge's discovery, and the thieves were doubtless
feeling as Mother Hubbard did when she opened the
bare cupboard door.  These particularly dirty dogs
had not even a bone to console themselves with,
either!
</p>

<p>
For reasons dictated by prudence, however, the
thieves quickly stopped their angry noise, and came
darting out of the cottage in a violent hurry.  Into the
motor-car they leapt, the bearded reciter proving the
sprightliest of the three.  It was a self-starting car of
a first-class make, and ought to have bounded forward
at a touch of the driver's hand.  Instead, it tottered
jerkily for a few yards, causing the driver to draw up
with a frightened oath.
</p>

<p>
"Punctured, by jingo!" he cried.  "One of those
confounded gorse-thorns must have jabbed itself into
us as we rushed up the incline.  Outside, chaps!
Quick!  Lift off the spare wheel and let's have it
fixed.  Those fellows behind there may be waking
presently."
</p>

<p>
"Here it is, on this side&mdash;the front wheel!" cried
the reciter.  "All together, boys, and we'll have her
on in a jiffy!"
</p>

<p>
The urgency of the occasion speeded their efforts,
and soon they were ready for re-starting.  But yet
another bitter disappointment awaited them.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, the old bus won't get a move on even
now!" snarled the driver.  "What in thunder's amiss
with her?"
</p>

<p>
They stared at each other in blank dismay for a
moment.  Then out jumped the driver again, and his
voice had a note of dread in it as he called out that the
rear wheel was punctured too.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" said the reciter, "an unheard-of thing!"
</p>

<p>
"See for yourself, idiot!" snapped the driver.  "It's
no thorn puncture, either.  Somebody's shoved a
knife into the tyre.  Here's a hole&mdash;clean cut."
</p>

<p>
The other two made a rapid examination of the tyre
and came to the same conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"But who the blazes could have done it?" queried
the reciter.  "Not those two sots behind us.  I doped
them too well; they're snoring still."
</p>

<p>
"The repair outfit, quick," the driver commanded.
"Willy nilly, we've got to mend this tyre or foot it,
and on Shanks' pony we may not be so lucky this time.
Somebody&mdash;goodness knows who&mdash;is aware we are
here, and has slashed us up.  It's the car or nothing
for us, now."
</p>

<p>
With feverish haste they applied every art of which
they were capable to the repair of the tyre.  But not
all the mechanical skill in the world can perform
miracles, and there is no royal road to tyre-mending.
Minutes that were precious to the trio slipped by, and,
though they encountered no set-back in their task,
it nevertheless seemed an endless one.  Therefore,
their nerves had reached a pitch of high tension when
the unmistakable sound of a swiftly-moving car caught
their startled ears.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" said the driver anxiously.  "Who
could need to be driving up here, and at dusk, too?"
</p>

<p>
"You're easily rattled, Dodger," sneered Cyrus the
Poet.  "Most probably it's the car of a local doctor,
called out to some yokel with a stomach-ache."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure," the driver said.  "Things don't
look healthy.  I vote we hop it.  The swag's gone&mdash;the
car's crocked&mdash;it's bad luck to hang around here."
</p>

<p>
He proved a true prophet.  Just as he finished
speaking the other car glided swiftly into view, and was
upon them before they could stir.  Half a dozen men
seemed literally to jump out of it upon the shoulders
of the trio.  They were men, too, of powerful north-country
build, almost ox-like in their strength, and the
three thieves had about as much chance amongst them
as rats in the mouths of trained dogs.  They had time
to make only the faintest show of fight before they
were lifted bodily into the capacious police-car, with
hefty constables practically sitting on them to keep
them quiet.
</p>

<p>
The game was up, and they resigned themselves to
the inevitable.  An inkling of the way in which they
had been trapped dawned on them as the car started
downhill, for from behind them there came the sound
of a boyish cheer, which raised mocking echoes among
the hills.  And at least one of them&mdash;Cyrus the Poet,
to wit, whose head was jammed uncomfortably against
the door&mdash;caught a sight of a posse of schoolboys
jumping joyfully down the hill, so that the secret of
the slashed tyres, and the sudden police raid, was laid
bare to him in the depths of his humiliation.
</p>

<p>
To the succour of the two drugged men the police-doctor
came in his own car, wherein were also Flenton
and the three swift-footed heroes who had raced into
town at Robin's bidding.  All the Merry Men went
willingly back to assist in lifting the still-stupefied
policemen, and, then, forming fours, they marched
down the hill in a singing procession, and entered the
school-yard with hoarse but happy shouts of triumph.
</p>

<p>
Thus, by a chain of fortunate circumstances, it had
fallen to the lot of Foxenby's boys themselves to avenge
the burglary at the school, and Old Man Wykeham's
delight almost choked his utterance as he proudly
announced to the assembled Foxes what Robin Arkness
and his Merry Men had done.  He promised them
another special holiday at a reasonable interval after
Shrove Tuesday, and made no protest against a
particularly boisterous dormitory supper which the
Juniors of both Houses arranged in honour of Robin
Hood and his Merry Men.
</p>

<p>
"There'll be a trial now," said Roger to Dick, "and
you, Robin Hood, and Fluffy Jim will be the star turns
in the witness-box."
</p>

<p>
"By the ears of the school donkey, I'll be nothing of
the kind!" exclaimed Dick.  "You're deliberately
trying to put the wind up me, Roger, you old fraud!"
</p>

<p>
"'Pon honour, Dick, I'm as serious as the Judge
will be on that solemn occasion.  They're bound to
subpoena you as a witness.  Probably I, too, will have
to go."
</p>

<p>
"You can jolly well be my deputy," said Dick, with
emphasis.  "I should blush and fidget like a first-form
kid reciting 'Casabianca' if they started quizzing me
in a public court."
</p>

<p>
Roger was right, nevertheless.  All three had to give
evidence at the trial, and Robin Arkness, for one,
showed a self-assurance which amused everybody but
the prisoners.  Nor could Dick have acquitted himself
so badly as he feared, for the cracksmen, all of whom
had given Scotland Yard trouble before, were sent to
ponder over their errors in the cold seclusion of a
convict prison, and it was quite possible that the picture
of the lonely cottage on the moor would haunt their
plank-bed dreams on many a fretful night to come.

CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
Home Truths for Luke Harwood
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"My dear Dick," wrote Aunt Bella, in a letter which
Dick received a fortnight later, "you were cheery
enough, and far-sighted enough, to assure me, when
the clouds were blackest and thickest, that the sun
would burst through them all.  Your sturdy optimism
heartened me immensely at the time, and saved me
many hours of worry, which, as events have since
proved, would have been sheer waste of nervous
force.
</p>

<p>
"In short, my solicitor's brother, being as proud as
he is rich, has taken to heart the blow to his family
honour, and has insisted on refunding every penny of
the money which his unfortunate relative embezzled.
I say 'unfortunate' advisedly, because mental
specialists have proved beyond doubt that my lawyer
was insane during the period of his dishonest actions.
He suffered from a form of legal kleptomania, all the
stupider because he, too, had money of his own to
play with, and had no need to toy with that of his
trusting clients.
</p>

<p>
"In these circumstances I am not a penny out of
pocket after all, and everything in the garden may be
said to be lovely again.  I had not, fortunately, had
time to leave my beloved home, and my golf-clubs are
in full swing again.
</p>

<p>
"I need scarcely say I read, with the utmost interest,
the racy account you sent me of your recent adventures
(naughty boy, not to have told me of your troubles
before).  Particularly was I pleased with your graphic
character-study of 'Chuck' Smithies, the bookmaker.
His trade, as you remark, is a rotten one, but we cannot
say the same of his big heart, which is as sound as a
bell.
</p>

<p>
"Purely because he did so much to keep your head
above water, I have sent him, anonymously, a few
boxes of cigars, which won't, I know, poison him,
because my brother Joe smokes the same brand
(extravagant man!) and is still very much alive!
</p>

<p>
"But it is with even greater pleasure that I enclose
herewith my donation to the <i>Rooke's House Rag</i>, the
new issue of which I hope shortly to have the pleasure
of laughing over.
</p>

<p>
"Keep yourself fiddle-fit for the re-played Final,
Dick, boy, so that this time your hefty foot may on no
account miss the target.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your chummy Aunt,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"BELLA."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The donation, of course, was liberal, and it really
seemed as though the sun-rays of prosperity were doing
their utmost to dazzle Dick's eyes of late.
</p>

<p>
The financial foundation of the <i>Rooke's House Rag</i>
was now firm.  Its new issue, fresh in style and
throbbing with life, infected the school with the
light-heartedness of its editors, and did something more to
restore the Captain to the popularity which he had
previously enjoyed.  Boys love the hero of an
adventure.  His star was in the ascendant again, and as it
rose, the star of Luke Harwood sank.  Even the Head
seemed to be losing interest in Luke, and "Wykeham's
Pet Fox" felt that the title no longer fitted him
as he roamed about the school, his uneasiness
ill-concealed beneath his habitual mask of composure.
</p>

<p>
For weeks he had succeeded in avoiding close contact
with Dick, there being a straight look of inquiry in
the Captain's eyes whenever their glances met, which
the Editor of the <i>Foxonian</i> found disturbing.  But he
could not for ever succeed in giving Dick a wide berth,
and there came a time, shortly after a football practice,
when the Captain stood directly in his path, and no
one else was about to whom he could hang on for
safety.
</p>

<p>
Making a virtue of necessity, therefore, he favoured
Dick with a slow, sweet smile.
</p>

<p>
"Team seems in wonderful form just now&mdash;should
make no mistake about the re-play," he commented.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sanguine as you appear to be, Harwood.
Much depends on circumstances.  We can't, for
instance, afford such another nasty little accident as
that which occurred in the last match."
</p>

<p>
"Most unfortunate, as I said in the <i>Foxonian</i> at the
time," murmured Luke.  "Still, who could have
foreseen the freakish action of an idiot?"
</p>

<p>
"Was it a freakish action, do you think?  Or did
somebody quietly put him up to it?"
</p>

<p>
"Preposterous, Forge; most absurdly unlikely!  No
Fox could have whispered anything so stupid and
harmful into the Village Idiot's ear."
</p>

<p>
"No Foxenby <i>boy</i> perhaps, but what was to
prevent a grown-up fellow trying it on&mdash;Ike Doccan,
for instance?"
</p>

<p>
The thrust was skilfully made, and its results
exceeded Dick's hopes.  Luke flushed to the eyes, only
to lose his colour a moment later, looking pale indeed.
He quickly regained his apparent serenity of manner,
but Dick had seen quite enough in that one frightened
look to convince him that it was worth while going on.
</p>

<p>
"I always believe in taking the bull by the horns,
Harwood," he said, "and there's nobody to hear me
if anything I say goes wide of the mark.  In plain
terms, then, why did Doccan egg on Fluffy Jim to
spoil my last-minute goal at Walsbridge?"
</p>

<p>
"Ike Doccan blacks the boys' boots, and I am not
accountable for his actions in or out of Holbeck's
House," answered Luke.  He was, to all appearances,
his old calm self again.
</p>

<p>
"Harwood, you're fencing.  In a duel of words I
know I stand no show.  Therefore, I make no bones
about saying that I believe you and your select gang
(inclusive of Ike Doccan) backed St. Cuthbert's to
beat us in the Final tie."
</p>

<p>
"Forge, that is a monstrous charge to make&mdash;have
a care!"
</p>

<p>
"Furthermore," went on Dick, "I believe that Ike
Doccan was acting directly to your orders when he
hoisted Fluffy Jim over the ropes to spoil my goal."
</p>

<p>
"Forge, I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up a minute&mdash;I know what you want to say.
You didn't move a hand-stir in the rotten affair&mdash;of
course not!  You were far too crafty a skunk for that,
so, after making a convenient guy of the Village Idiot,
you hired a minion to do the rest of your dirty work
for you.  Deny it if you can!"
</p>

<p>
"It's all your imagination, Forge."
</p>

<p>
So meek and mild was the tone of this reply that the
prefect of Holbeck's House might merely have been
denying that he had been guilty of making a pun.
Already he was edging furtively away, wishing, no
doubt, that there were acres of green fields between
him and this hard-eyed Captain of Foxenby.
</p>

<p>
"In other words," said Dick, "you call me a liar!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Forge!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, Harwood!  Betting on a school match
is bad enough&mdash;wagering against your own side is
infinitely worse."
</p>

<p>
"You seem very certain of your facts!"
</p>

<p>
"I could prove them up to the hilt if necessary.
But your shifty eyes are sufficient testimony for me.
You can't look me straight in the face!  You played
your low-down game of bluff cunningly, Harwood,
hunting magazine subscriptions for me, 'soft-soaping'
my <i>Rag</i>, fooling me with your tongue in your
cheek!  And all the time (how clearly I see it now)
you were scheming in secret to pull me down&mdash;to
jockey me out of the Captaincy and set yourself up in
my place."
</p>

<p>
"You're a liar!" cried Harwood, stung at last into
open defiance by this keen home-thrust.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Dick.  "That's more sporting of
you.  Look out for your eye now!"
</p>

<p>
Out shot the Captain's fist, and down to the grass
went Harwood, with the marks of Dick's knuckles on
his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Harwood, lift yourself up and let's have it
out once and for all.  Don't stay sprawling there&mdash;that
little tap can't have hurt you.  What, aren't you going
to fight? Come along, man!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm having no more, thanks," Harwood replied, in
the tremulous voice of a craven.  "Fighting's no sort
of fun for me.  I'm out of condition&mdash;you're as hard
as nails."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of all the beastly funks&mdash;pooh, Harwood,
what a first-class rotter you are!  I wish I hadn't gone
for you&mdash;it's a waste of powder and shot.  Luckless
Holbeck's to have a worm like you as a prefect!  Get
up and don't be scared.  I wouldn't touch you again
with a pole!"
</p>

<p>
Saved by this contemptuous promise from further
violence, Luke rose groggily to his feet, making a great
pretence of being badly shaken.
</p>

<p>
"Drop swinging the lead, Harwood, and listen to
me a minute.  The date of the re-played Final has been
fixed.  The game will be at Walsbridge as before.
But you won't be there, Harwood.  Neither will
Doccan, nor any other of your gambling clique.  You'll
find some excuse for not going, all of you&mdash;understand?"
</p>

<p>
"But how can I promise for anybody save myself,
Forge?"
</p>

<p>
"You arranged matters to your liking before&mdash;it will
be just as easy to do it again.  For the good of the
school, you and your gang have got to be missing.
We shall breathe cleaner air in your absence."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;" began Harwood, desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Promise, or take a hiding, whichever you prefer."
</p>

<p>
"No need to make a scene, Forge; I'll manage it
somehow."
</p>

<p>
Dick laughed scornfully.  "I thought you would.
Go now, and be quick about it.  I'd rather not be
seen within half a mile of you!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
A Merry Man's Magazine
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the mind of the Captain of Foxenby there lingered
pleasantly the riddles he had heard at the Robin Hood
concert.  Some of them would, he thought, make a
bright addition to the fun columns of <i>The Rooke's
House Rag</i>, but it was necessary first to get the author's
permission to print them.
</p>

<p>
While crossing the yard with Roger he caught sight
of Robin Arkness, and gripped that mercurial youngster
by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Say, kid, you're a dandy riddle-maker.  It'll be
decent of you if you'll let me put a few of those Foxenby
conundrums in the next number of <i>The Rag</i>."
</p>

<p>
Robin coloured, took off his cap, and nervously ran
his fingers through his yellow hair.
</p>

<p>
"They weren't my riddles, Forge," he stammered.
"I got 'em from&mdash;from somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Not from a book," said Forge.  "They were
slap-bang up-to-date stuff, poking excellent fun at us.
Really, now, you don't mind if I publish a few of them,
do you?"
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward silence.  Robin cast two or
three quick glances at Roger, who frowned back at
him and shook his head.  In this action he was
detected by Dick, who looked from one to the other in
dawning comprehension.
</p>

<p>
"Now I smell a rat!" he exclaimed.  "Roger,
you sly old fox, how many of those riddles did you
write?"
</p>

<p>
Robin and Roger saw this time that the cat was
too far out of the bag to be replaced.  Both giggled
rather foolishly, while the Captain laughed at them.
</p>

<p>
"Cut away, Robin," said Roger.  "Keep everything
squat still.  Better to leave them guessing."
</p>

<p>
Robin pelted away willingly, glad to be relieved of
the secret which he and the prefect had shared.  The
riddles had been so much talked about, and he had
been so closely questioned concerning them, that
the sudden fame thrust upon him had become embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
Still, he had enjoyed the sensation for a time, and
an idea struck him now which thrilled him suddenly
with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Robin to himself, "shouldn't the
Merry Men have a jolly old magazine all to themselves?
Not a big printed thing, of course, like the <i>Foxonian</i>
or the <i>Rag</i>.  Just pocket-size, so that a fellow could
slip it inside his Latin grammar and read it in school
hours."
</p>

<p>
No grass ever had the chance to grow long under
Robin's feet.  At once he called a meeting of the
Merry Men in the quietest corner of Rooke's House,
and put his proposal before them with infectious
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Champion!" Little John voted the idea.
</p>

<p>
"It's a winner, Robin!" said David of Doncaster.
</p>

<p>
"I'll write a serial for it," said Allan a Dale.
</p>

<p>
"I'll draw some coloured butterflies," said the
Miller.
</p>

<p>
"Put me down for some pictures of wild animals,"
said the Tinker.  "I live in Regent's Park, outside
the Zoo."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be bashful," observed Dave.  "Say <i>inside</i>
it, Tinker."
</p>

<p>
Several other Merry Men promised contributions,
varying from ghost stories to verses on skylarks and
redbreasts.  Almost all were full of zeal, and Robin
glowed with proud anticipation as he saw, in imagination,
his new magazine packed with gems of literature
and art.
</p>

<p>
"What'll you call it, Robin?" asked Little John.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the <i>Merry Men's Magazine</i>, of course,"
answered Robin.  They all agreed that no title could
be better.
</p>

<p>
"How much will you charge for it?" somebody asked.
</p>

<p>
Ah, that was an important question!  It was nearing
the middle of the term, and the coins still remaining
in some of the Merry Men's pockets were feeling a
draught.
</p>

<p>
"Nixie," said Robin.  "There'll be no subscription."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come off it, Robin!  Printing's dear and paper's
dear."
</p>

<p>
"I can cadge some paper," said Robin.  "And
printing will cost nothing.  We'll print it ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"I say, this sounds exciting!" said Little John.
"With one of those rubber printing-presses, eh,
Robin? I love messing about with those."
</p>

<p>
"I don't," said Dave.  "It's all right making up
the lines, but what about putting the type back in its
place afterwards? That gets skipped."
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," said Robin.  "When I said 'print',
I meant pen-print.  The magazine will consist of
thirty-six small sheets of paper, pocket-size.  Each
Merry Man will write or draw his contribution on a
sheet of the paper, and hand it back to me within two
days.  I'll then fasten the sheets together and pass
the 'Mag' from boy to boy in the Form.  No reader
will be allowed to keep it longer than a day.
Otherwise, it wouldn't go the rounds before the term-end."
</p>

<p>
Though some of them may have felt that this was
not a very practical scheme they withheld their
criticism, accepted sheets of unruled paper from Robin,
and went to seek inspiration in the most secluded spot
available.
</p>

<p>
A day or so later contributions started rolling in, and
Robin began to realise how much more trouble than
joy there is in the life of an editor.
</p>

<p>
Allan a Dale's serial gave him a topping send-off.
It was called "King of the Road", and concerned a
highwayman whose adventures had those of Dick
Turpin beaten to a frazzle.  This gentleman, proudly
calling himself "Helter-skelter Hal", chivied a coachful
of fat politicians over a cliff, made a king stand on
his head in a snowdrift, held up three stage-coaches
simultaneously with two pistols, rescued a maiden in
distress by hauling her through a carriage-window
and riding with her across a tree that bridged a raging
torrent, and then attacked single-handed, and put to
flight, a score or more armed footpads who were
robbing the Governor of the Bank of England.  Not
such a bad series of incidents for a first instalment!
</p>

<p>
So far, so good.  The first jar came when Little
John, trustiest of Robin's comrades, brought in his
contribution.  This was a full-page drawing of a
football match, supposed to be the final tie for the County
Schools' Cup.  Little John had written this title
beneath it, and he had put goal-posts at each end of the
field.  But for these descriptive touches it might just
as well have pictured a bull-fight, or a cannibal dance
round a missionary in a stew-pot.
</p>

<p>
"I say, old chap, this is a bit fierce," Robin
commented, rather blankly.  "A wee bit out of perspective,
isn't it? These trees, for instance, look as if they
were in the middle of the field."
</p>

<p>
"What trees?" asked Little John, wonderingly.
"Those? Here, don't be silly.  Those are our
forwards and St. Cuthbert's halves having a wrestle for
the ball."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, really," said Robin politely, "I beg your
pardon.  But why this sheaf of corn behind the goal?
Queer place for a wheatsheaf, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Wheatsheaf be blowed!" cried Little John,
indignantly.  "Robin, you ought to get some spectacles.
That's Fluffy Jim in his paper costume."
</p>

<p>
"All serene," agreed Robin.  "I'll put a cross over
his head and write his name underneath the picture,
so's everybody will know.  Passed for publication.
Next gentleman, please!"
</p>

<p>
The boy who was called Friar Tuck approached him
and handed him a sheet of verse.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" asked Robin "'Musick in ye
Forest'.  Why the 'k' in 'music', Friar?"
</p>

<p>
"That's how they used to spell it in those days,"
said the Friar.
</p>

<p>
"But those days aren't these days," said Robin.
"Here, get your heads out of the light, you two, while
I read the first verse."
</p>

<p>
Heedless of the self-conscious blushes of the
embarrassed poet, he commenced to read:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'In ye forest of Ancient Sherwood,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the deer so blithely skip,<br />
  There strode the doughty Robin Hood<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a horn upon his lip.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Here, shiver my timbers, this is weird," commented
Robin.  "What's Robin Hood want with a horn upon
his lip? He's not a stag or a bull!  Even if he were
either, horns grow on foreheads, don't they?"
</p>

<p>
"You haven't twigged it properly, Robin," explained
the Friar.  "Read on, and you'll see what it
means."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Three blasts upon his horn he blew,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each mounting high and higher,<br />
  Come forth, my Merry Men, quoth he,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear me strike the liar.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I understand about the horn now, Friar.  But who
are you making the liar?"
</p>

<p>
"Not me, I hope," put in Little John.  "If so,
I'll knock your head off, you bounder."
</p>

<p>
Friar Tuck took a hasty peep at the manuscript.
"Excuse me a moment," he said.  "Did I write
'liar' instead of 'lyre'?  Slip of the pen.  Alter it,
Robin."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll let it stand; it's funnier," said Robin.
"Get your ears back for the next spasm, friends:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'And withal Robin danced like fun,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried, Hey diddle, diddle,<br />
  While Little John his cornet blew<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And David scraped his fiddle.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Here, hold on a bit, Friar.  Fiddles they may have
had in Robin's time&mdash;I'm not sure of it&mdash;but cornets
weren't invented.  Even if they had been, Flenton
couldn't play one."
</p>

<p>
"This is <i>that</i> Little John, not this one," the Friar
pleaded.  "Cut the cornet out, Robin, and make it
what you like."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Robin, "this is your funeral, not mine.
Here's the Tinker with his picture.  Hope the Royal
Academy folk won't be jealous."
</p>

<p>
The Tinker's gait was almost a swagger.  Whatever
others might think of his picture, the artist himself
was evidently convinced of its dazzling merits.
</p>

<p>
"Just dashed it off after lunch," he said airily.  "Can
do you a dozen more like it, if you'll let me have the
paper."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Tinker; must leave room for another genius
or two," said Robin.  "By Jove, these are clinking
cows.  Could almost fancy I could hear them 'moo'."
</p>

<p>
"Cows, carrots!" exclaimed the Tinker.  "Chuck
pulling my leg&mdash;no cows there, Robin."
</p>

<p>
"What are they, then?  Buffaloes?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stop kidding, Robin.  You know very well
those are flamingoes, drawn to the life from the Zoo."
</p>

<p>
"Right!" said Robin.  "We'll mark them with a
capital 'F', and put 'Flamingoes' in a footnote.  The
others describe themselves.  These hippopotami, for
instance&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Robin, you're trying to be smart," said
the Tinker, in aggrieved tones.  "You must surely see
those are laughing hyenas."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, to be sure," agreed Robin.  "They're laughing
at those sore-eyed zebras in the corner.  I see now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is beyond a joke," growled the angry
Tinker.  "Can't tell tigers from zebras!  Here, let's
point them all out to you before you muddle them up
any more."
</p>

<p>
"Later on, old chap," Robin told him, putting the
picture in his pocket-book.  "Time's scarce now.
Here's the Miller with his butterflies.  More R.A.'s
than authors amongst the Merry Men, evidently."
</p>

<p>
The Miller's butterflies washed out the rainbow in
vivid colouring.  They were having a glorious feed
in a wonderful garden, the only flaw wherein was that
daffodils, roses, hollyhocks and chrysanthemums were
all blooming simultaneously.  Another minor detail
was that some of the butterflies seemed as big as crows,
altogether dwarfing the flowers.  It was, indeed, a
scene of tropical splendour!
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried Robin, heaving a sigh of relief.
"This'll do O.K."
</p>

<p>
The earlier contributors, with the exception of
Allan a Dale, shot a jealous glance at the Miller,
grudging him Robin's praise.  All unconsciously their leader
had deeply wounded their pride.
</p>

<p>
Too anxiously occupied with his editorial duties to
notice the clouds that were gathering, Robin turned
next to David of Doncaster, whose contribution proved
rather a shocker.  It was called "Celebrated
Executions&mdash;written and illustrated by David Storm."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Dave, what a hang-dog ruffian you are!"
Robin exclaimed, trying to hide his dismay under a
laugh.  "This makes milk-and-water of the Chamber
of Horrors.  Charles the First, Anne Boleyn, Sir
Walter Raleigh, Lady Jane Grey&mdash;heads flying about
like tennis balls.  As for the hangings, they're
positively gruesome.  Charles Peace, Palmer the Poisoner,
Neil Cream, Mrs. Dyer, and nine or ten more of 'em
on the gallows&mdash;I shan't sleep to-night if I look at this
much longer."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you put it in, then, Robin?" asked Dave
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rather, Dave!" Robin said.  "It shall face
the Tinker's frisky Zoo.  That'll be a foil for it.  Any
other gentleman obliging with a contribution before
the tea-bell rings?"
</p>

<p>
There was a slight pause, and then another Merry
Man, known to the band as The Tanner, timidly
handed in a written attempt.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a short story," Robin commented.  "That's
a change from verse and pictures, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
He took it nearer to the lamp and commenced to
read aloud.  It ran as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'She was dead.  Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was
dead.  Her little bird&mdash;a poor slight thing the pressure
or a finger would have crushed&mdash;was stirring nimbly in its
cage; and the strong heart of its child-mistress was mute
and motionless for ever.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Why," said Robin, breaking off at this point, "it
sounds like something I've read before somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"I should jolly well think it does," Dave interjected
indignantly.  "My sister recited that at the Parsonage
party last Christmas.  It's the 'Death of Little Nell',
from Dickens' <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You young beggar, you've prigged it!" Robin
accused him.
</p>

<p>
The shamefaced copyist tried to brave it out.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what if I did?" he asked defiantly.  "You
only gave us two days' grace, and I got three separate
headaches trying to do something funny."
</p>

<p>
"You should have just sent in your photograph
and saved yourself the trouble," said Dave.
</p>

<p>
Robin pocketed the contribution rather dejectedly,
and was relieved when the clanging of the tea-bell
saved him from further criticism.
</p>

<p>
"Meet me round the bonfire in the Forest to-morrow
afternoon, my men," he said.  "There'll be the usual
quantity of venison pasties to give the magazine a start."
</p>

<p>
On a sharp and invigorating afternoon, when the
crackling bonfire was a sheer delight, they feasted right
jovially on the contents of Robin's pack.  It was a far
finer spread than ever he had given them before, and
he was the soul of good temper throughout.  Finally,
when all were satisfied, he drew from his pocket a
sewn-up copy of the magazine.
</p>

<p>
"List ye, my Merry Men.  Right earnestly have ye
striven to fill to overflowing the pages of our first
number.  Yet, by my troth, now that it is done and
put together, it likes me not.  It is a dud, a frost, a
fizzle, a wash-out."
</p>

<p>
There was a chorus of disappointed cries.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Robin, what's amiss with it?" asked Little
John, in consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Amiss with it?" echoed Robin.  "Look here at the
title-page.  What saith it?  <i>The Merry Men's Magazine</i>.
What's bound to be expected of a 'mag.' with a name
like that?  Fun and frolic from first page to last.  I
turn to page 23.  What do I find?  An article on
famous executions.  A bright and cheerful subject!
Page 24 introduces us to 'The Deathbed in the Shop'.
Page 27 tells us how a party of old Foxes walked into a
sandbank and never were seen again.  Page 31 contains
'Curious Graveyard Epitaphs'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They were funny ones," put in the compiler of
them, protestingly.
</p>

<p>
"Funny as a boiling lobster," retorted Robin.  "How
about this one?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'The poor boy here was starved at school,<br />
  One meal a day was this school's rule.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Very funny, I don't think&mdash;being starved to death.
Then what price this one:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Here lies the body of young Jim Sawner,<br />
  Of him his mother is a mourner.<br />
  To you youths let this be a warner&mdash;<br />
  Grim Death lies waiting round the corner.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That's the sort of stuff undertakers sit up all night
reading," said Robin, "but Foxes would drop big
ink-blots on it.  Then, to finish up, page 34 is a picture
called 'Early Christian Martyrs thrown to the Lions'.
Fancy them coming early-doors for that!  I admit it's
a good picture&mdash;but where's the merriment come in?"
</p>

<p>
"You're pretty down on all of us, Robin," said
Little John ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"No, chaps," replied Robin, seriously.  "I don't
want us to make fools of ourselves, that's all.  I was
an ass to start this magazine.  If it passed round
Foxenby we'd be the laughing-stock of the place.  Poke
the fire up, Dave&mdash;that's the ticket.  A lovely blaze.
Here's a bit more fuel to keep it going."
</p>

<p>
With that he suddenly cast the magazine into the
heart of the flames, while the others gasped with
amazement at the sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Thus perished the first and last number of the <i>Merry
Men's Magazine</i>, and neither the editor of the Foxonian
nor the co-editors of <i>Rooke's House Rag</i> ever knew how
near they had come to the sudden eclipse of their
greatness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
The Three-cornered Tournament
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Never had the Squirms, as a body, succeeded in
scoring points over the Merry Men.  Duffers at
football and cricket, which they only played because both
were compulsory, slackers in the gymnasium, and too
flabby to shine in athletic sports, their chief recreations
were indoor ones which did not fret their fat, such as
chess, draughts, and dominoes.
</p>

<p>
At these three games they frequently played to pass
away the long winter evenings, while other boys
indulged in gymnastics and boxing.  Consequently,
quite a number of them became, through constant
practice, fairly proficient in table games&mdash;certainly far
cleverer at them than other Foxes of their own age, who
seldom cared to play with them.
</p>

<p>
"I've got a rattling good idea for taking the starch
out of Robin and his gang," Osbody announced to a
little group of Squirms.  "Their beastly heads are
swollen to the size of balloons over the flukey way they
nabbed the burglars.  Odious to see them swanking
about, isn't it, chaps?"
</p>

<p>
"Makes me sick," agreed Grain.
</p>

<p>
"Positively nauseating to hear Old Man Wykeham
puffing 'em up sky-high," said Niblo.  "Special
holiday in their honour, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"I vote we all stick in the class-room and swot that
day, just to show our contempt for it," suggested Vinns,
a boy with a rather uncanny gift for mathematics&mdash;the
only Squirm who had ever distinguished himself in a
scholastic way.
</p>

<p>
"Swot yourself, Professor Vinns," snorted Grain.
"I'd swop all my school-books for a penny bag of
popcorn.  Time to wonder how to spend the holiday when
it comes.  Just now, I'm waiting to hear 'Body's plan
for wiping Arkness's eye."
</p>

<p>
"It's this," said Osbody.  "Half the Merry Men
(as they have the cheek to call themselves) scarcely
know one end of a chess-board from another.  Dominoes
are just slabs of wood to them.  Draughts make them
shiver."
</p>

<p>
"Granting all that," said Niblo, "I don't see what
you're driving at."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we all want to take Robin's conceited 'crush'
down a peg, I guess?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!  Aching for the chance."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's yours for the asking.  Not to make a
song of it, I've written something on a sheet of paper
which, if you're all agreeable, I shall send to Arkness
to-night.  Listen, and I'll read it."
</p>

<p>
He smoothed out a sheet of foolscap, cleared his
throat, and began:
</p>

<p>
"We, the Foxenby Junior Games Club, hereby
challenge Robin Hood and his Merry Men to a
three-cornered tournament, viz: Games of Chess, Draughts,
and Dominoes, to be played in the Holbeck House
Games-room on Friday evening next."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, great gingerbreads, that's ripping!" said Niblo.
</p>

<p>
"Best idea ever!" said Vinns.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted Grain.  "Must be grass-green,
both of you, if you fancy they'll rise to a bait like that."
</p>

<p>
Osbody looked annoyed.  Grain's habit of throwing
cold water on everything he suggested was always a
thorn in the flesh of the leader of the Squirms.
</p>

<p>
"See nothing to sneer about, Grain," he snapped.
"Why shouldn't they bite?"
</p>

<p>
"They'll make paper pellets of the challenge," Grain
persisted.  "What asses they would be to play us on
our own pitch, so to speak, at games they don't stand an
earthly in.  Fancy Arkness bringing his men like lambs
to the slaughter!  He's too fly for that!"
</p>

<p>
"I agree," said Niblo, with a sigh of disappointment.
"It won't come off, 'Body, old man.  Better make
paper boats of the challenge than give Robin the chance
to be sarcastic about it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Vinns.  "He's confoundedly clever at
writing skits."
</p>

<p>
But Osbody stubbornly declined to be talked out of
his venture.  "Stow your jaw, everybody," he said.
"This challenge is going, whatever you say.  I'm
positive it's the only way of taking a rise out of Arkness
and his Shrubbery hooligans."
</p>

<p>
"It'll come back like a boomerang," growled Grain.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if it does, only my head will suffer, for I shall
sign it," said Osbody.  "Here, younker," he broke off,
collaring a First-form boy who was trying to slip past,
"take this paper to Robin Arkness, in Rooke's House.
Look alive, now."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Robin was reading out the
challenge to a group of Merry Men in the "gym".
Its arrival quite knocked the steam out of a ding-dong
glove-fight between Little John and Friar Tuck, old
rivals in pugilism.  They ceased banging each other
and gathered round Robin with the rest.
</p>

<p>
"What a beastly lot of one-eyed badgers," exclaimed
David of Doncaster.
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" agreed Will Scarlet.  "Licked at everything
that matters, they want to draw us into chimney-corner
and parish-tea games."
</p>

<p>
"No jolly fear," said Little John.  "Chess always
gives me a headache."
</p>

<p>
"Same here," said the Miller.
</p>

<p>
"I always end by building castles with my dominoes,"
said the Tinker.
</p>

<p>
"Draughts strikes me as a sort of girl's game,"
another Merry Man put in.
</p>

<p>
"Allan a Dale's the only man we have who can play
all three games decently," the Tanner declared.
</p>

<p>
"Good idea," said Dave.  "Set Allan on playing
Osbody, and we'll all stand round to watch."
</p>

<p>
Shy Allan hastily declined the honour, whereupon
Robin, having waited for the hubbub to subside, gave
his opinion.
</p>

<p>
"Cheek in chunks, but artful&mdash;particularly artful,"
he said.  "We don't want to play the Squirms at
games.  We don't want to sit in the same room with
them.  We'd rather play snakes-and-ladders with the
Tinker's flamingoes at the Zoo."
</p>

<p>
"We would indeed!" cried Will Scarlet.  "Send
him a snorting answer, Robin."
</p>

<p>
"Refuse the challenge, do you mean?" queried Robin.
</p>

<p>
"I should say so, thumbs down."
</p>

<p>
Robin shook his head sadly.  "We can't," he
groaned.  "If we did, they'd never afterwards cease
yapping at us.  Oh, yes, I can see you staring at me,
but what would you say, chaps, if Osbody put up his
dukes to me in the Shrubbery and sang out 'Come on'?"
</p>

<p>
"We'd tell you to go for him, Robin, like old steam."
</p>

<p>
"Just so.  It would be a challenge, and you'd
expect me to take it.  If he said, 'I'll race you up the
Moston Church-side to the steeple', daft though that
would be, I'd have to climb with him.  Twig what I
mean, boys?  The Merry Men's reputation is at stake.
We cannot refuse."
</p>

<p>
Many of them decidedly differed from this opinion.
Why, they argued, should they give the Squirms the
chance of scalping them in a tournament of Osbody's
own choosing? But Robin was not to be shaken.
</p>

<p>
"I'll put that right, chaps," he said.  "Give me two
minutes while I answer the challenge."
</p>

<p>
He scribbled furiously for a time and then read out
the following:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"We, the Merry Men, accept the challenge of the
Foxenby Junior Games Club to play them at Chess,
Draughts, and Dominoes on Friday evening next IF
they will agree to play us at football on the following
Wednesday afternoon.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"(Signed) <i>Robin Hood</i>."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Good!" exclaimed David of Doncaster.  "That's
a facer for them, Robin."
</p>

<p>
"You've turned their flanks," commented Will
Scarlet.  "The mere thought of meeting us at footer
will make them goggle-eyed."
</p>

<p>
"It'll wash out the Games Tournament, hurrah!"
cried Little John, intensely relieved.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too cocksure of that, fellows," said Robin,
gloomily.  "I hope it will, but we've got to be ready
for anything."
</p>

<p>
He found a messenger to carry the answer to Osbody,
whose face lengthened somewhat as he read it aloud to
his cronies.
</p>

<p>
"There, you've let us in for it now!" cried Grain,
angrily.  "Didn't I warn you the boomerang would
come back? Fancy having to play 'em at football!
The bare idea gives me a stitch in my side."
</p>

<p>
It was a turning of the tables which the Squirms had
not even remotely anticipated, and they followed
Grain's lead in heaping reproaches on Osbody's head.
But he, too, had a will of his own, combined with a gift
of leadership almost equal to that of Robin.
</p>

<p>
"Chaps," he said, "have I ever failed you as a leader
of this band? We have had some pretty rough times&mdash;when
did I ever show funk?"
</p>

<p>
They were compelled to admit that he had stood by
them through thick and thin.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then," said Osbody.  "Either I'm to
have the pleasure of leading you to victory once in a
while, or the whole bag-o'-tricks goes overboard.
Football or no football afterwards, we're playing this
games' tournament on Friday evening."
</p>

<p>
Grain's crafty eyes lit up with sudden hope.
"Nobody's indispensable," he said, significantly.
</p>

<p>
Osbody shot a fiery glance at his rival.  "Let the
fellows choose!" he snapped.  "I'll have my way, or go."
</p>

<p>
If Grain had any serious hopes of stepping into
Osbody's shoes at that moment, his disappointment
must have been intense.  Fully twenty of the Squirms
were present, and they crowded round Osbody with
assurances of loyalty that did them credit.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, 'Body," said "Professor" Vinns.
"Revenge is sweet, and for once we'll have it."
</p>

<p>
"So we will," said Niblo.  "At chess, draughts,
and dominoes we'll make crawling worms of them.
They shall taste the dust beneath our feet."
</p>

<p>
"Just as we shall taste the mud beneath <i>their</i> boots
when the football match comes off," sneered Grain,
savagely.
</p>

<p>
"Rats to the old football match!" said Niblo.  "If
necessary, we will play two goalkeepers to hold the
score down.  Friday comes before Wednesday, and
thrice-armed is he who gets his blow in first."
</p>

<p>
In the few remaining days before the tournament
some of the Merry Men tried desperately hard to rub
up their knowledge of indoor games.  Allan a Dale,
bashful and slow-spoken as a rule, became almost as
loud-voiced as a drill-sergeant in his efforts to teach
chess and draughts to his chums.
</p>

<p>
Lovers of the open-air as they were, their thoughts
were continually wandering from the chequered board.
Robin alone made satisfactory progress.  It was up to
him, he believed, to set his men a good example, though
all his eloquence failed to keep Little John longer at
the chess-board than fifteen minutes at a time.
</p>

<p>
"I shall just move the pieces anyhow and trust to
luck," Little John said.
</p>

<p>
"Then your opponent will wipe the floor with you."
</p>

<p>
"If he does," said Little John, grimly, "let him look
out for himself when I meet him on the football-field,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, it was this thought of out-door
revenge which sustained the dejected Merry Men when
they took their seats for the tournament on Friday
evening.
</p>

<p>
Osbody had arranged the order of things most
craftily.  First came dominoes, as the game in which
there was only a slight element of skill.  It was natural
that the Merry Men would score a few points at
dominoes, though three-fourths of them were
well-beaten, Robin and Allan being amongst the losers.
</p>

<p>
The Squirms were openly exultant.  Even Osbody
had difficulty in repressing a triumphant smile.
</p>

<p>
"Draughts next," announced the leader of the
Squirms.  "Any particular fancy about pairing off,
Arkness?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll play you," said Robin.  "The other fellows
can sort themselves out as they like."
</p>

<p>
Osbody whispered something to Vinns, who casually
dropped into a chair opposite Allan a Dale.  This was
a pre-arranged plan, for "Professor" Vinns was as
weirdly clever at board-games as he was at mathematics,
and all Allan a Dale's skill proved powerless to
prevent him winning.  Their game lasted longest, but
the result was never in doubt.  Allan, the hope of the
Merry Men, was cornered and beaten.
</p>

<p>
No sum of subtraction was needed to reckon the
tally in favour of the Squirms.  They had won every
game but two drawn ones, Osbody having failed to beat
Robin, and Grain having found in Will Scarlet an
opponent too tough to knock out.
</p>

<p>
"Something like an evening's sport," commented
Osbody.
</p>

<p>
"Most enjoyable," murmured Niblo.
</p>

<p>
These happy meetings ought to become a permanent
feature," said "Professor" Vinns, beaming
over his glasses at his crestfallen opponent.
</p>

<p>
"I beg to differ," said Robin.  "Not in an
atmosphere like this, anyhow.  Phew!  I can scarcely
breathe!  I vote we have all the windows open, chaps;
the place is like a furnace."
</p>

<p>
Some of the Merry Men ran at once to the window-cords,
but Osbody violently protested.
</p>

<p>
"Windows open be hanged!" he cried.  "It's
freezing outside.  There's a sea-breeze that cuts like a
knife.  We should all get our deaths of cold."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!" retorted Robin.  "Fresh air never
harmed anyone.  Better to shiver than be baked alive.
I feel like a bread-loaf in an oven."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help that," snapped Osbody.  "I hate to
sit in a draught.  What do you other fellows say?"
</p>

<p>
The Squirms unanimously agreed with their leader.
It would, they said, be like courting almost certain
death from influenza or pneumonia to open the windows
on such a night.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Robin, "it comes to this: we want air
and you want suffocation.  What's the polite rule in
these cases? The visiting team is given the choice.
Are you for ventilation, my Merry Men?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, Robin!" the Merry Men cried, with one voice.
</p>

<p>
"Fresh-air fiends!" snorted Grain.
</p>

<p>
"We shan't agree," said Osbody.
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," cried Robin easily.  "There's only
one thing to do, then.  We'll leave the tournament as
it is, and call it a draw."
</p>

<p>
The Squirms stared at one another in blank
consternation.  To be robbed of their sweeping victory in
this freakish fashion was a misfortune not to be borne.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy-rot!" exclaimed Osbody.  "We haven't
played a single chess-game yet."
</p>

<p>
"Funkpots!" sneered Grain.  "You're afraid to see
it through."
</p>

<p>
For answer Robin pulled down the upper part of a
big window and his Merry Men followed his lead,
flooding the over-heated room with sweet night air.
</p>

<p>
"There, that's better!" cried Robin.  "Carry on
with the chess."
</p>

<p>
The Squirms were outmanoeuvred.  They had
either to abandon full and complete victory or finish the
tournament in a torrent of air which swept their score-cards
to the floor.  So, with sinking hearts, and the
sourest of faces, they turned up their coat-collars and
decided to "stick it".
</p>

<p>
At chess most of the Merry Men went down like
ninepins, some of them having difficulty in
distinguishing knights from bishops.
</p>

<p>
Once again the Squirms swept the board.  Allan a
Dale and Robin, by dint of mental gymnastics which
made their heads swim, wrung draws from Vinns and
Osbody respectively; but these partial successes only
threw the general rout of the Merry Men into stronger
relief.  Just as they had expected, they were decisively
and ignominiously thrashed.
</p>

<p>
Immediately the Squirms became a Mutual Admiration
Society.  Hands were wrung and shoulders were
slapped, and in every way the Merry Men were made
to feel that they were very small potatoes indeed.  In
unutterable disgust at such exceedingly bad taste, they
trooped to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Here, aren't you going to give three cheers for the
winners?" Osbody called after them.
</p>

<p>
With eyes that blazed contemptuously Robin flung
round on him.
</p>

<p>
"No, we're not," he said.  "This wasn't a tournament
from the start.  It was like a rabbit-coursing
match, where they blind and starve the rabbits before
they let the dogs loose."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!" Osbody scoffed.  "It was man to man.
We met on even terms!"
</p>

<p>
"All serene," answered Robin.  "Hope you'll
think the same when we're dry-rubbing you next
Wednesday!"
</p>

<p>
He hurried his Merry Men out of the room, and then,
as a parting shot, popped his head round the door to
shout&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hot water-bottles and babies' comforters, this way!
All dirty Squirms with stiff necks should grease 'em
with goose-fat.  Like cures like!"
</p>

CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
The Merry Men Score Goals
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In football garb the Squirms, on the whole, looked
unimpressive.  They had bulk, but it was beef without
brawn.  Some of them had so outgrown their togs that
their arms stuck out sideways, in a grotesque
semi-circular fashion.  Others had fat faces, too, which
turned unhealthily blue in the wind.
</p>

<p>
"What a mug's game it is," grumbled Grain.
"We're prize idiots to appear at all."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't honourably do otherwise," retorted
Osbody.
</p>

<p>
"Honour be hanged!  We're not heroes of a sporting
novel.  Look at the crowd of Foxes round the ropes.
They've come to laugh at us!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they'll cheer us before we've finished."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!  We're all as soft as putty.  Given
football a miss whenever possible.  Hated the muddy
misery of it.  The Merry Men will tie us into every
kind of knot."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, fusspot!" said Osbody, with spirit.  "It's
rotten bad form to cry 'stinking fish'."
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" agreed Niblo.  "Where's the sense of
piling up imaginary goals against your own side, Grain?
Grouse when they're actually scored, not before."
</p>

<p>
"You're living in a fool's paradise," retorted Grain.
"Go on kidding yourselves that you're an International
side.  All I can say is, that you don't jolly well look
it.  More like a row of plucked turkeys outside a
poulterer's shop."
</p>

<p>
His bitter comments were interrupted by the arrival
of the Merry Men, looking fit as fiddles in their white
shirts and blue knickers.  Rosy-cheeked and bright-eyed,
full of vim and confidence, they formed a striking
contrast to their shivering opponents.  Judging by
appearances, there would only be one team in the
picture that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Osbody, as captain, met Arkness in the centre of the
field.  "Who's to referee?" he inquired.  "I forgot
to ask about that."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," Robin answered cheerily.
"Thought we'd have a good 'un while we were
about it.  I've asked Forge to take the whistle."
</p>

<p>
"You never dared!" cried Osbody, evidently taken
aback.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  Forge doesn't bite.  What better
'ref.' could we have?  He'll see fair play to the last
kick."
</p>

<p>
"Who said there was going to be any play that wasn't
fair?" asked Osbody, ungraciously.
</p>

<p>
"Not I, you thin-skinned beggar.  All I meant was
that Forge knows the rules backwards way.  He'll hold
the scales even and favour neither side."
</p>

<p>
"That's as may be," remarked Grain.  He had come
up behind them with his customary cheek to butt into
the conversation.  "Some people know how to wangle
things.  Even school-captains swallow butter occasionally."
</p>

<p>
Robin looked at Grain with cold contempt.  "Here
comes Forge," he said.  "Time to start.  If you'll
ask your men to stand back, Osbody, we'll toss for
ends."
</p>

<p>
A cordial cheer greeted Forge, who concealed an
amused smile with difficulty as he saw, through the
corner of his eye, the long faces the Squirms were
pulling at his appearance.  Doubtless they would have
preferred a milder and shorter-sighted referee.
</p>

<p>
Dick shook hands with both captains in a manner of
becoming gravity.  It might have been a First League
match, so seriously did he take it.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, chaps," he said.  "Ideal afternoon
for footer.  Winning the toss won't help either
of you much.  Hope we'll have a pleasant game."
</p>

<p>
The news that Dick was refereeing quickly spread.
It was a totally unexpected honour for a junior match.
Usually the captain was too busy leather-hunting
himself to take any notice of scratch games.  That he had
decided to referee this contest between the Merry Men
and the Squirms excited curiosity, resulting in a rapid
thickening of the ring of spectators round the ropes.
</p>

<p>
It was all very depressing to the Squirms.  They had
hoped against hope that the crowd of onlookers would
be small, having a lively fear that they were bound to
make fools of themselves.  The advent of the captain
as referee had turned the limelight full on them, and
more than half Foxenby would now be present to deride
their floundering efforts at football.
</p>

<p>
"Arkness did it on purpose, the crafty bounder,"
they told one another.  "This is his revenge for the
tournament licking.  Nice figures of fun we'll look
after a bit."
</p>

<p>
"Buck up, chaps, and put all in," Osbody counselled
them.  "We're eleven against eleven, after all.
Use your weight and knock some of the steam out of
them at the start."
</p>

<p>
With Niblo in goal, and himself at left full-back, the
captain of the Squirms really made a gallant attempt to
save his side from immediate humiliation.  Doing the
work of three players, he nipped in time after time to
throw the Merry Men's scoring schemes awry.  His
only mistake in the first fifteen minutes was to bring
Robin down somewhat roughly when a goal seemed
certain.  Forge took a charitable view of the foul and
merely awarded an ordinary free kick.  This Niblo,
who was playing a surprisingly good game, fisted away
with convincing force.
</p>

<p>
"We're doing top-hole, chaps," Osbody told the
Squirms.  "Get farther down the field, you forwards,
and chance your luck more."
</p>

<p>
Grain could play decently enough at centre-forward
when he liked, but was lazy by nature and a confirmed
grumbler.
</p>

<p>
"Talking's easy," he sneered.  "Fat lot of attacking
you'd do yourself if you'd two sugar babies instead of
players at each side of you."
</p>

<p>
"Try a gallop on your own anyhow, Grain.  You're
big enough."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Plenty for them to kick at, you mean.
Hadn't you better get back towards goal, 'Body, before
the squibs go off?"
</p>

<p>
Truly, Osbody had been caught napping.  The ball
had been restarted while he was talking, and Dave and
Robin had lured the other full-back into a booby-trap.
He zigzagged in bewilderment towards Niblo, whose
toes he trod on, with the result that the hampered
goalkeeper had the mortification of seeing the ball lobbed
past him for the first goal of the match.
</p>

<p>
"You clumsy clown!" he cried to the faulty fullback.
"Either keep off my toes or get off the field.
You gave them that goal!"
</p>

<p>
Bad temper is the worst opponent a goalkeeper can
have.  While he remained cool Niblo had kept goal
excellently well; now that he was hot and cross he
could do nothing right.  Robin beat him again with
quite a simple shot; Dave bagged a couple more in as
many minutes, and the thrashing which the Squirms
themselves had expected began in real earnest.  Niblo's
sole occupation seemed to be that of picking the ball
from the back of the net and booting it savagely back
to the centre of the field.
</p>

<p>
Osbody wiped his forehead in miserable perplexity.
"Nine goals to nil," he said.  "This is sheer slaughter,
Niblo.  Steady, old man, steady!"
</p>

<p>
"Right, 'Body, old son," answered Niblo.  "I lost
my head, but they're all on top of me.  Can't you go
to your old place and draw them off me a bit?"
</p>

<p>
"Good idea, Niblo.  I'll feel more at home at
centre-half, putting a spoke in Arkness's wheel."
</p>

<p>
Grain watched the change with cynical approval.
"Time you came to give me a hand," he said.  "The
Professor's no more use behind me than a draughty
keyhole."
</p>

<p>
"Have a pot at goal whenever you can, Grain.  We
must get a chalk or two, or it'll be 'thirty&mdash;nil' on the
hall notice-board."
</p>

<p>
Between them they managed to get a move on,
juggling the ball into the Merry Men's penalty-area by
deft touches which won applause.  Osbody was then
in a splendid scoring position, and ought to have shot
without hesitation.  Probably wishing, however, to put
Grain in a better temper, he unselfishly gave his
grumbling colleague the ball, saying to him: "Let fly first
time, Grain."
</p>

<p>
It was what is known as a gift-goal.  The Merry
Men's custodian had slipped and fallen, and Grain had
only to lift the ball gently into the net.  But the
excitement of the moment must have unnerved him, for
instead of shooting he trod on the ball, which flew up
and hit him in the face.
</p>

<p>
The next moment, to the accompaniment of a loud
roar of laughter, he had sprawled full length in the
mud.
</p>

<p>
There was mud on this particular patch of the field,
too.  It was facetiously called the "Nigger Pond",
because on most days a pool of black water was present
there.
</p>

<p>
If Grain had been in the habit of practising more he
would have remembered this patch and kept clear of it.
But now he was wholly in it from head to foot, sending
a fountain of black drops over Osbody also, and (what
was worse still from his captain's standpoint) spoiling
all chance of a score by accidentally fisting the ball over
the goal-line.
</p>

<p>
When, at last, he managed to raise himself dolefully
to his feet, who was there on the field who could have
refrained from grinning at him?  Black he was, but not
in any way comely.  His appearance was that of a
golliwog too tightly stuffed with sawdust&mdash;an irresistibly
comical sight.
</p>

<p>
The spectators exploded with mirth; the Squirms
laughed even louder than the Merry Men; Forge himself
could not keep a straight face, and laughed aloud
with the rest.  Only Grain failed to see the broad
humour of the thing.
</p>

<p>
"Keep it up, you blinking idiots!" he snorted, as he
flung the mud from his blazing eyes.  "Pretty cads
you all are to make game of a fellow's misery."
</p>

<p>
"Cut off and change, Grain," Dick advised him.
</p>

<p>
"So I will, and I shan't come back," whined Grain.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," Dick returned.  "Take it in good part,
youngster.  Your side needs you.  Play the game."
</p>

<p>
Grain ran off sulkily, and at half-time, when the
Merry Men had a dozen goals to their credit, he had
washed off the mud and made himself presentable in a
clean costume from the emergency kit.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, kid," Dick said to him.  "You're
going in again.  Better luck next time."
</p>

<p>
Grain grunted something in an off-hand manner&mdash;a
piece of surly cheek which Dick tactfully ignored.
But the captain of the school decided to keep a watchful
eye on this unmannerly young Squirm, whose ways
were far from being ways of pleasantness.
</p>

<p>
The bulk of the crowd had melted away at half-time,
the game being too one-sided to hold their attention.
It was just target practice for the Merry Men's forwards
and halves, and runaway victories quickly pall on
unbiassed spectators.
</p>

<p>
But it gradually became evident that the play was
becoming too warm for some of the combatants.  Cries
of "Stop that, you dirty cad!" were audible at intervals,
and Dick had at last to push himself unceremoniously
between two sparring opponents, one of whom was
painfully hopping up and down on a bruised leg.
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, Storm&mdash;that's enough, Grain," said
Dick.  "This is a football-field, not a rat-pit."
</p>

<p>
"I was nowhere near the ball when he hacked me,"
pleaded Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Rot!" said Grain.  "You fell over my foot.  I'm
as much hurt as you."
</p>

<p>
"Better temper, please," said Dick, restarting the
game.  But this time he paid less heed to the play in
general than to the movements of Grain in particular.
Very soon he saw something which confirmed his
suspicions.  Pretending to head a ball which was
nowhere near him, Grain scraped some skin off Arkness's
knees with his boot, while striking the back of his hand
against Tom Jaye's nose, causing that organ to bleed a
little.
</p>

<p>
Dick promptly blew his whistle and ran to the scene.
"Free kick against you, Grain," he announced.
"Don't be more like a windmill than you can help.
It's dangerous!"
</p>

<p>
Grain smiled in a supercilious sort of way, and,
folding his arms like a gladiator, contemptuously
watched Dave take the free kick.  To show how utterly
a word in season was lost on him, the next minute he
literally jumped, knees up, into Allan a Dale's back,
sending that lightly-built and altogether harmless
Merry Man somersaulting over the ropes.
</p>

<p>
"Here, stop rotting, you lout!" cried Robin, his
blood boiling.
</p>

<p>
Grain's immediate answer was an uplifted fist and a
vicious blow at Robin's face.
</p>

<p>
Robin saved his beauty, not to mention a considerable
amount of sticking-plaster, by ducking swiftly and
taking the hard smack on his shoulder.  There were
cries of indignant disgust from players and spectators
alike.
</p>

<p>
"How's that for dirty play, referee?" somebody
shouted.
</p>

<p>
Dick needed no such reminder of his duty.  Like an
avenging force he fell upon Grain and gripped the
Squirm's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Clear off the field, Grain!" he commanded.  "Out
of it.  March!"
</p>

<p>
"Ridiculous," protested Grain.  "I only charged a
man off the ball."
</p>

<p>
"You might have snapped his backbone like a
carrot.  Make yourself scarce and don't argue."
</p>

<p>
But Grain <i>did</i> argue.  To the awed amazement of
both Squirms and Merry Men, he fired a lot of
audacious back-talk at the grimly-silent captain.
</p>

<p>
"You can't send me off, Forge," he declared.
"Haven't power to.  This isn't a league match or a
cup-tie.  You weren't asked to referee&mdash;at least, not
by our side.  I've done no harm; why should I go?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the why and the wherefore," snapped
the captain.  "Take yourself off."
</p>

<p>
Grain looked round at the frightened faces watching
him, and had a mind to show them what a devil-may-care
fellow he was.
</p>

<p>
"Shan't!" he answered, with a stupidly defiant
laugh.
</p>

<p>
He was asking for trouble there, and did not seek in
vain.  Round the back of his neck Forge's fingers
fastened like a vice.  He next felt himself lifted over
the ropes as though he were no more than a bag of
shavings, and at a furious and undignified speed he was
hustled to the gate of the football-field and pitched into
the lane.
</p>

<br />
HE NEXT FELT HIMSELF LIFTED OVER THE ROPES
</p>

<p>
"Stay there till the dust-cart picks you up, you
vermin," said Dick, with withering scorn.
</p>

<p>
After that the game was better and brighter.  Nobody
said anything, but everybody felt that a spirit of
mischief had been erased from the match.  Osbody fell
back to defend again, and he and Niblo put up so
stout a defence that the Merry Men could only score
twice more before Dick's whistle blew for time.
</p>

<p>
Still, twenty-three goals to none represented a
terrible drubbing for the Squirms, and one that made
their tournament victory seem a very feeble triumph
indeed.
</p>

<p>
Yet nobody seemed the least inclined to rub the
licking in.  The Squirms, with one conspicuous
exception, had played a clean game, and kept their
tempers in humiliating circumstances.  Just, then, as
they were trooping dejectedly from the field, they were
electrified by hearing Robin's familiar treble calling
out:
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers for Osbody's team, you fellows&mdash;hip,
hip, hooray!"
</p>

<p>
Forge turned to listen in smiling approval as the
Merry Men whole-heartedly gave three cheers.  Osbody
blushed like a girl and gazed apprehensively round at
the Squirms, wondering how they would take this
totally unexpected outburst.  Then, swinging his arm
round his head, he cried to them:
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers for the winners, you chaps."
</p>

<p>
What matter that the Squirms' cheers were but
throaty croaks compared with the full-voiced hurrahs of
the Merry Men?  They did their best in an unaccustomed
part, plainly realizing that their honourable foes
had treated them in a thoroughly sporting spirit.  Not
to have responded in a similar vein would have
disgraced them in Foxenby's eyes.
</p>

<p>
Glancing at one another sheepishly, they made haste
to leave the field, but were overtaken by Dick Forge,
who accommodated his pace to theirs.
</p>

<p>
"You chaps look down in the mouth," the captain
said, briskly.  "Don't be.  You've no need.  There's
quite decent footer in some of you.  All you require is
practice.  You've played particularly well, Osbody.
Ditto you, Niblo."
</p>

<p>
The two leading Squirms flushed with unconcealed
delight at this compliment from Foxenby's greatest
footballer.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but they made all sorts of rings round us,
Forge," Osbody stammered.
</p>

<p>
"True.  Served you right.  You loafed about indoors,
getting flabbier than jellyfish, while Arkness and
Co. hardened themselves outside.  I am pretty keen
on footer, as you know, boys.  When a Fox has legs
to stand on I like to see him chasing a ball with them,
even if he never catches up with it.  Now, tell me, are
you chaps game to stick together and practise footer
every week, for the honour of Foxenby?"
</p>

<p>
A quick little catching of breath was audible here and
there.  What could the Squirms do when the great
captain of Foxenby was pleading with them thus?  His
whole heart was in his voice&mdash;his deadly earnestness
could not be mistaken.  The meanest boy amongst
them knew how passionately Forge loved Foxenby, and
his pure devotion to its interests was infectious.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, Forge, we'll practise like the very
dickens&mdash;won't we, you chaps?" said Osbody, turning
on them a pair of eyes that shone with new resolution.
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" they answered, in somewhat tremulous
chorus.
</p>

<p>
"Good biz," commented Forge, as he turned aside
into Rooke's House.  "It bucks me up no end to hear
you say so."

CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
Two from Eleven leaves Nine
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Nominations for the School Captaincy had to be
sent in a fortnight before the actual election took place.
Great fun had always been extracted from the annual
event, particularly in the Junior School.  Consequently
there was blank consternation, particularly in Holbeck's
House, when the school librarian gave it out that only
one nomination paper had been sent in.
</p>

<p>
"There must be some mistake&mdash;a ghastly bloomer,"
said Broome, of Holbeck's House.  "Papers mislaid,
no doubt.  Why, I signed Harwood's nomination
paper myself."
</p>

<p>
"So did I," said Lake.
</p>

<p>
"And I," agreed Atack.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Mr. Librarian, stop rotting," Broome said.
"Practical joking in a matter of this kind shows bad
taste."
</p>

<p>
"Have a square look at me, chaps," said the librarian.
"Do I look like a jester in cap and bells?"
</p>

<p>
"More like an ink-bottle with a quill stuck out of
it," said Lake.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Then don't accuse me of mucking up
my job.  Richard Forge alone has been nominated for
the Captaincy, and will therefore be elected unopposed."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" queried Robin Arkness, always to
the fore when anything was afoot.  "Dick Forge
Captain of Foxenby again?  Luke Harwood not nominated?
Jolly good job for Harwood, then.  He'd have
got the slugging of a lifetime if he'd stood."
</p>

<p>
"Hop it, cheeky, or you'll get my boot-toe," was
Lake's threat.
</p>

<p>
"Jealous!" Robin taunted him.  Then off flew the
leader of the Merry Men to acquaint his comrades of
the glorious tidings that Forge was captain for another
year&mdash;an occurrence which they celebrated by carrying
paper banners round the school-yard and heartily
boo-ing any boy of Holbeck's House whom they
suspected of being Luke Harwood's partizan.
</p>

<p>
"Rather a staggerer, Luke not letting himself be
nominated," said Roger to Dick.  "He didn't stand
an earthly, of course, but still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Think I can explain his shyness on this occasion,"
Dick answered.  Whereupon he confided to his chum
what had taken place between him and Luke in the
deserted football-field.
</p>

<p>
"All going to prove how accurate was your opinion
of his character, and how far astray was mine," Dick
concluded.  "But we'll be decent to a fallen enemy,
Roger, old boy."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," Roger agreed.  "No kicking a man
when he's down.  I heard a rumour that he'd decided
to leave Foxenby this Easter.  <i>Sic transit gloria</i>!"
</p>

<p>
It was the morning of the replayed cup-tie at
Walsbridge, so they had every good reason for dismissing
Luke Harwood from their minds.  Luke, indeed, did
not buy a railway-ticket for Walsbridge, nor were any
of his cronies on the platform.  Another notable
absentee was Fluffy Jim, whose parents had taken him
to the Stores that day to fit his awkward limbs, if
possible, into clothes that Mr. Wykeham's reward had
ensured for him.
</p>

<p>
"So we start under better conditions to-day,"
laughed Roger.  "No blue-and-white Guy Fawkes
this time to kick away your goal."
</p>

<p>
"If the Octopus lets me get near enough to score
one," Dick reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your big toe out of the way of his seven-league
boots, anyhow," was Roger's timely warning.
</p>

<p>
Reaching Walsbridge by rail from Moston was
rather a depressing experience.  It entailed a long wait
at a draughty junction, where refreshment was difficult
to obtain.  Footballers who train at the seaside develop
healthy appetites, and the grub provided on this
occasion didn't satisfy some members of the team, who
fared forth to forage for more.
</p>

<p>
"Don't dawdle, Clowes&mdash;come back quickly,
Broome," Dick counselled them.  "No rotting about
to-day, remember!"
</p>

<p>
"We could eat the town up and then be back half-an-hour
before this clockwork hearse of a train started,"
Broome said.
</p>

<p>
"Better be on the hungry side than gorge," said
Dick, anxiously.  "Stick to beef-sandwiches&mdash;no
pickles or fried potatoes, mind!"
</p>

<p>
Not caring to seem fussy about diet, but fearing the
effect of too much indifferent food, Dick watched the
pair leave with some concern.  Then he and Roger
strolled about the platform, deriving amusement from
the vocal rivalry of the Merry Men and the Squirms,
who tried which could first shiver the glass roof of the
junction with their shrill football slogans.
</p>

<p>
"We're handicapped by this changing business,
Roger," Dick said.  "St. Cuthbert's get a through
train to Walsbridge, and can start after luncheon, warm
and well-fed.  It's quite on the cards that those
ravenous beggars, Broome and Clowes, will come back
bilious from greasy grub."
</p>

<p>
"If they come back at all," commented Roger,
glancing grimly at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"My hat, it's five minutes off train-time!" Dick
exclaimed.  "Confound the slackers, they're cutting
it fine.  Here, Arkness, slip into the street and see if
you can spot Broome and Clowes.  Signal them up,
smart!"
</p>

<p>
Such an errand could have been trusted to no one
quicker than Robin.  He vanished like a streak, only
to return three minutes later with a furiously-shaking
head.
</p>

<p>
"No sign of 'em, Forge," he panted.
</p>

<p>
A pretty pickle, truly!  Supporters aboard the train,
guard fidgeting with his green flag, and two of the
team's most important members missing.  Was the
replay, then, to be as persistently dogged by misfortune
as the first final had been?
</p>

<p>
"Guard, can't you hold her up a bit?" Dick pleaded.
"Give us a minute or two longer.  We're two men
short."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, lad, but Ah might near as weel chuck myself
under t'train.  This company's pride is punctuality.
They'd sack me if I spoilt t'record.  Ready, there?
Right away!"
</p>

<p>
He bundled Dick and Roger into the saloon carriage
reserved for the team, and waved the train into motion.
Gradually it gathered speed, and then a frantic shout
arose from the watching Foxonians as Broome and
Clowes came rushing at top speed past the booking-office.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, they're here&mdash;stop the train!"
</p>

<p>
Trains have been stopped, I believe, on less particular
lines when important passengers have been a few
seconds late.  And who more important, the Foxes
doubtless thought, than two of the men who were to
fight St. Cuthbert's for the County Schools' Cup? But
their hopeful cries changed into dismayed indignation as
they realized that the old file of a guard had no intention
of pulling up for Broome and Clowes&mdash;"No, not if
they was royal princes," he vowed.  Had he even
extended a helping hand, the nimble Broome could have
just boarded the guard's van.  But the old man
remained stubborn, and the team started on the last lap
of its journey to Walsbridge minus two of its best men.
</p>

<p>
"Take a motor-car," Robin Arkness called back,
"and charge it to me."
</p>

<p>
"Silly ass!" Osbody said.  "There isn't anything
better than a clothes-horse to ride in this benighted
hole.  We've lost the match!"
</p>

<p>
"Skittles!" cried Robin.  "You Holbeck chaps make
me sick.  Just because two out of three of your rotten
representatives think feeding their ugly faces more
urgent than football, you fancy it's 'tails down' with
Foxenby.  Forge'll find substitutes for both, that's a
cert.  He's never been stuck fast yet."
</p>

<p>
But Robin's confidence would have been shaken
could he have peered into the saloon and seen the
worried look on the captain's face.
</p>

<p>
It might be true, as Robin declared, that Dick had
never been stuck fast before, but on this occasion he
did indeed feel that he was up against one of the
toughest football problems of his life.  For the reserve
centre-half was Luke Harwood, and the reserve inside-left
was Greenfoot, both members of the little gambling-gang
whom Dick himself had warned off the Walsbridge field.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Ennis, "Harwood's been aching for a
chance all the season, and is not such a wash-out at
centre-half.  His opportunity's come at last."
</p>

<p>
"Jiggered if I fancy Greenfoot as a cup-tie forward,"
said Lyon.  "He'll be a new broom, but not such a
sweeping one as Broome."
</p>

<p>
"Where are those two, by the way?" asked Lake.
"Can't remember to have seen 'em at the station."
</p>

<p>
"Come to mention it, neither can I," rejoined
Ennis, and most of the other members said the same.
</p>

<p>
Dick knew it was time to take the bull by the horns,
and he did so with characteristic candour.
</p>

<p>
"Neither Harwood nor Greenfoot can play this
afternoon," he said, "for the simple reason that they
haven't come."
</p>

<p>
"Not come!" exclaimed Lyon.  "But what in
thunder's the good of a trained reserve if it's left playing
marbles in the school-yard?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Forge, this is a staggerer!" Lake put in.
"Surely you should have seen to it that those two came
along to-day."
</p>

<p>
"There were reasons why they shouldn't," said
Dick curtly.  "I take full responsibility.  It was I
who told them to stay behind.  Don't ask me why, for
I prefer not to tell."
</p>

<p>
They stared at him strangely.  Only Roger understood,
and he itched to give the team the good and
proper reason for the absence of Harwood's gang.  If
the team knew that the missing reserves were infected
by the gambling-taint they would, Roger was certain,
emphatically approve the captain's action in leaving
them behind.  Without this knowledge, they could be
pardoned for thinking the captain's action high-handed.
</p>

<p>
Nobody spoke for a time.  Some turned angrily red,
others looked sulky, all seemed more or less resentful.
But Dick did not spare himself.  As usual, he went the
whole hog by saying:
</p>

<p>
"They're absent, chaps, and even if they'd been here
they wouldn't have played.  I shouldn't have let them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I say, Forge, you're not the whole
committee," exclaimed Lake.
</p>

<p>
There being a slight murmur of approval at this,
Roger deemed it his duty to break a lance in defence
of his chum.
</p>

<p>
"You fellows are forgetting," he said, "that, by the
rules of Foxenby, the football captain is in entire
command on the day of the match.  If reserves are
needed, he chooses them himself to suit the occasion."
</p>

<p>
"Clever," sneered Lake.  "You'll be called to the
Bar if you're not careful, Cayton."
</p>

<p>
But none could deny that Roger's reading of the
rules was correct.  If the captain chose to discuss
matters with the rest of the team, it was purely an act
of grace on his part.  He could, if he wished, mentally
complete his team without consulting anybody.  Being
neither an autocrat nor a fool, he preferred to seek their
advice before coming to a decision.
</p>

<p>
"We've some spare shirts and knickers in the bag,"
he said.  "Can anybody suggest a decent centre-half?"
</p>

<p>
Three names were mentioned, and thrice Dick shook
his head.
</p>

<p>
"You can't fit a round peg in a square hole," he
remarked.  "I must have somebody who's played
centre-half before."
</p>

<p>
"Ditto at inside-left, I suppose?" asked Lyon.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely, Lyon."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm jiggered if you'll find anybody," said
Lyon, in despair.  "We shall have to field nine men
and chance it."
</p>

<p>
Dick looked calmly round at the ring of dissatisfied
faces.  "Any other fellow got a proposal to make?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
There were several negatives, some surly, some
peevish.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Dick.  "I must settle this little
dilemma in my own way.  The centre-half of the
second eleven is young Osbody.  The second-string
inside-left is Robin Arkness.  Both are sturdy kids, and
will fill out the costumes fairly well.  So to-day they
play."
</p>

<p>
The speech of a Hyde Park "tub-thumper" could
scarcely have met with more open ridicule than this.
There was laughter of a sarcastic description; some
even professed to believe that the captain was joking.
Even Roger caught his breath a little in surprise.
Osbody and Arkness were such striplings, after all.
The wily Cuthbertian cracks would surely toy with
them.
</p>

<p>
Unmoved by criticism, even smiling a little, Dick
took from his pocket the list of the team and calmly
wrote in the names of the unpopular substitutes he had
chosen.  Replacing the list, he turned to gaze out of
the window at the landscape, whistling softly to himself.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><br />
A Gift-goal for St. Cuthbert's
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The directors of the Walsbridge Football Club had
been badly "caught out".  They ran hither and
thither in perspiring helplessness, wondering vainly
how to deal with the crowd, which swamped all their
turnstiles, and leaned its weight in threatening bulk
against the creaking wooden gates.  Such a throng to
see a schoolboys' match had never entered into their
calculations.  Their turnstile men couldn't take the
money fast enough.
</p>

<p>
An urgent telephone message brought extra police,
and the directors themselves took off their coats and
took on the admission-money at the same time.  Thus
they packed the ground, with the result that every tree
and house-roof in the neighbourhood was speedily
black with the excluded spectators.
</p>

<p>
Such a multitude would have cheered the hearts of
an adult club, but it was more than a little unnerving
to some of the schoolboy players.  Particularly
awe-struck were Arkness and Osbody, who had brought
spring-rattles and tin trumpets with them, intending to
make a cheerful din under the blue sky of a spring day.
Instead, they were bidden to the captain's presence,
and coolly told to slip their quaking limbs into the
shirts and knickers made ready for them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, it's not the first of April, Forge," Robin
ventured to say, pathetically.  "You&mdash;you're pulling
our legs, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall faint straight away," chattered Osbody,
looking white enough to justify what he said.
</p>

<p>
"Buck up, youngsters," said Dick.  "Don't get
stage-fright.  You'll fall into your stride after a bit."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but it's so&mdash;so awfully unexpected," Robin
stammered.  "W-W-Why are we p-p-playing, Forge?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I wish you to, kid," answered Dick.
"Isn't that enough?"
</p>

<p>
Robin pulled himself together and somehow conjured
up a smile.
</p>

<p>
"It's enough for me," he replied.  "I'll stick it out
till I'm carried off the field on a shutter."
</p>

<p>
"You'll both be as right as rain," said Dick
encouragingly.  "I'll look after you, so don't worry."
</p>

<p>
His reassuring manner masked nervousness, nevertheless.
The fellows were inclined to take offence at
the watering down of the team by the inclusion of
Juniors, and Dick was amazed to find them saying
nasty and disheartening things to Osbody and Arkness.
</p>

<p>
"Give the youngsters a chance, chaps," he said.
"Be sportsmen!"
</p>

<p>
None of them cared to continue baiting the kids after
that, for Dick had a straight way with him which made
defiance of his will an uncomfortable business.  Ennis,
who had said nothing at all, had the good grace to go
on the opposite tack by cheering the youngsters up,
an example which Lyon and some others followed, and
the team generally felt lighter in heart when a better
feeling prevailed.  To start divided amongst themselves
would be like making a present of the match to
St. Cuthbert's.
</p>

<p>
Outside the dressing-room Dick was hailed by
"Chuck" Smithies, very quietly dressed, for him, in
navy blue, and quite obviously relishing an excellent
cigar.
</p>

<p>
"One of the clinking brand which came from your
sporting aunt, sonny," he said.  "Oh, I guessed it was
she!  Is she here?  No?  Sorry&mdash;I'd have liked to
thank her personally.  I don't usually attend these
games, laddie, but I determined to come here with
clean hands.  Haven't booked a single bet on the match.
What a crowd!  No village idiot or tomfool mascot
about on this occasion, I trust?  Good!  Then go in
and chew their ears off."
</p>

<p>
"Chewing the ears off" St. Cuthbert's would have
been easier if they had left Bessingham out of the team.
But the Octopus was there again in all his might,
heart-and-soul in the game from the kick-off, bringing Fox
after Fox within uncomfortable range of his long legs,
and brushing aside Robin Arkness's plucky attentions
as he would have swept a fly from his forehead.
</p>

<p>
The great crowd made delighted noises as Bessingham
coolly broke up every attack, and they laughed
good-naturedly at Osbody's ludicrous attempts to get
somewhere near the ball.  The wily Cuthbertian
forwards made rings round the lad, who, in desperation,
lunged blindly at the ball, and kicked it the wrong way.
Taken by surprise, Lyon tried to intercept it, but
only succeeded in turning it out of the reach of Ennis,
who had the mortification of watching it bob into the
goal at the top corner.  Lyon and Osbody between
them had scored for St. Cuthbert's in the first ten
minutes of the game, and that one luckless goal might
all too probably settle the ownership of the Cup.
</p>

<p>
Thus early, then, had Dick's insistence on his own
way brought humiliation to Foxenby.  Clowes would
never have made such a glaring error as to kick towards
his own goal on a still afternoon like this.  Clowes
would never have let the Cuthbertians cross the
half-way line, of course.  But then, Clowes didn't happen
to be there.  He had preferred the fleshpots of Egypt
to the County Schools' Cup, and to blame the captain
for his absence was short-sighted and unfair.
</p>

<p>
Blame him they did, all the same.  Why had he left
Harwood at home? Furthermore, with reserve players
to choose from who were bigger and brawnier by far,
why did the obstinate beggar insist on including two
scuttling Juniors, both of whom were trembling like
leaves now under the hypnotic influence of the Octopus?
</p>

<p>
Fortunate beyond words was it that Lyon proved
himself, for the remainder of that scrappy half, almost
as great a full-back as the Octopus.  He was unjust to
himself to take bitter blame for putting the ball through
his own goal, but the remembrance of that smarting
reverse spurred him into a dazzling exhibition of
defensive play.  The Cuthbertian forwards could
never get round him.  He was full-back and centre-half
combined, kicking and heading with splendid
accuracy, keeping Ennis's hands idle for half-an-hour,
smothering every shot in the locker of St. Cuthbert's
helpless forward-line.
</p>

<p>
"They'd never have scored in a blue moon if Osbody
hadn't managed it for them," groaned Lake, at half-time.
</p>

<p>
Dick levelled a straight look at the grumbling
forward.  "Remember the proverb about people in
glass-houses, Lake," he answered.  "We haven't
shown much scoring form ourselves."
</p>

<p>
As though to pile on misfortune, Clowes and Broome
turned up by a later train&mdash;full of useless apologies, of
course, but seemingly rather glad of the important
difference which their absence from the side had made.
</p>

<p>
"I think, Forge, if you were to put it fairly to the
Octopus, he would consent to us going on instead of
Arkness and Osbody," said Broome.
</p>

<p>
"Don't make childish suggestions, Broome," said
Dick.  "And please don't flatter yourselves, either of
you, that I'd take you on if I could.  Better a willing
pair of Juniors than a couple of slacking Seniors."
</p>

<p>
Having sent this well-deserved shaft home, Dick
took Arkness and Osbody quietly aside, and spoke to
them also for their good, but in a very different way.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," he said, "I think we're all three a
jolly sight more polite to Bessingham than we need be.
We rot round him too much, and help him to become
the darling of the crowd.  Has it struck either of you
that St. Cuthbert's are playing a deal worse, on the
whole, than they did last time, when you two were
spectators?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes," agreed Robin.  "They peppered
Ennis with shots then&mdash;he's a looker-on to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, kid.  Now there's a golden chance for you
two to come right into the limelight if you'll only take
a friendly tip from me.  I want you to forget you're
footballers, and to try to fancy that you're nurses
spoon-feeding me and Meynard&mdash;he'll catch forward
passes up with his raking stride, never fear.  Stop
thinking for yourselves&mdash;become feeding-machines pure
and simple.  Are you game?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" the two Juniors cried, in delighted agreement.
</p>

<p>
"That's good.  You two are keen rivals, I know,
but you both rather admire each other, and I want you
to realize this afternoon that you're pulling together in
a great cause&mdash;for the honour and glory of Foxenby, to
wit.  Come, now, shake hands on it!"
</p>

<p>
Out shot the hand of Robin Hood, and the leader of
the Squirms grasped it eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried the captain, as he turned to lead his
men on to the field again.  "Follow me, boys.  We're
all going out to the very last ounce this half!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap28"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><br />
The Winning of the Cup
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The big crowd was strangely quiet at the recommencement
of play.  It had come together with great
expectations, promising itself a lot of corking thrills, for
the magic of the previous duel between Forge and the
Octopus had never lost its charm.  Everyone knew that
the champions of Foxenby and St. Cuthbert's must be
keyed up to their very highest pitch, and wondered
whether, in the time that had elapsed since the last
match either of the captains had developed any new
wiles by which to obtain a superiority over his rival.
The game was bound to be a great one for the
spectators.
</p>

<p>
But on this occasion the scoring of St. Cuthbert's
gift-goal seemed to have robbed the game of interest.
The spectators apparently took it for granted that the
Cup would become St. Cuthbert's, for Bessingham
alone would see to it that no equalizer was scored.
Foxenby (silly beggars) had "mucked up" any chance
they had by shoving two weedy nippers into the team.
St. Cuthbert's, even if they failed to score again, had
only to play out time to win, opposed to a disheartened
side that couldn't raise a gallop.  Thus the crowd
argued, wishing by now that it could have its money
back and go home.
</p>

<p>
Well, there is no game so full of sensational surprises
as football, and it fell out that the second half was in
vivid and delightful contrast to the first.  The ball
hadn't been in motion two minutes before everybody
noticed that something different was happening.
</p>

<p>
Of fancy work there was none&mdash;gallery play was to
be scrapped, evidently.  Twice in quick succession
Meynard got away on the left wing, and put across two
fine centres which Forge and Lake nearly made into
goals, one shot striking the cross-bar and the other
glancing off the goalkeeper for a corner.  Though
Meynard dropped this flag-kick on to the net by trying
to make too sure a thing of it, St. Cuthbert's were
visibly rattled by these narrow escapes.
</p>

<p>
"That outside-left of yours has got a rare turn of
speed," remarked a Cuthbertian to Lyon.  "He needs
watching."
</p>

<p>
So they started watching him, forgetting that while
two men are playing policeman to one, his pal goes
unmarked and free.
</p>

<p>
This was where Robin's smaller size came in.  What
could a little chap like that do, anyhow?  St. Cuthbert's
had ceased to reckon him.  So, cottoning to a
significant glance from his captain, Robin stood with
apparent listlessness behind the Cuthbertians who were
worrying Meynard, snapped a chance, scraped the ball
from their heels, and passed it back to Dick, who
promptly swung it out to Lake.  Lake dribbled till
Bessingham came thundering down, and then ballooned
the ball back to Dick, who nearly made a hole in the
goalie's chest with a drive so fierce that the crowd
bellowed joyfully.
</p>

<p>
In this vigorous little scene the Octopus played
second fiddle, and probably he was more surprised than
anybody to be left out of the movement.  Having, with
the rest of his side, held Robin and Osbody cheaply in
the first half, some fifteen minutes went by before it
struck him that the improvement in the play of the two
Juniors was having an effect on the run of the game.
And by the time he and his colleagues woke up to the
change the mischief had been done&mdash;Foxenby had
scored an equalizing goal.
</p>

<p>
Funniest goal of the season it might possibly be
called&mdash;either a side-splitting fluke, or a piece of
football wizardry never before attempted.  Only Robin
Arkness could say in which class to place it, for it was
that bright-faced youngster who, with his back to
St. Cuthbert's goal, and just outside the penalty-area,
screwed the ball over his head into the top angle of the
sticks, from whence it rebounded into play again.
Robin span round and met it with his forehead, and it
flew into the net like a cannon-ball at close quarters,
making the astonished goalkeeper look and feel like a
ventriloquist's dummy.
</p>

<p>
The great roar of cheering which greeted this
extraordinary goal might have turned Robin's head if he had
known for certain that it was still on his shoulders.  But
his delighted team-mates, swooping down upon him to
smother him with congratulations, saw him sink to the
ground in a dazed fashion, with both hands clasping
the nape of his neck, which Robin quite thought, as he
confessed afterwards, to be broken.
</p>

<p>
"Buck up, kid," said Lyon.  "My stars, what a
goal!  The crowd's crazy about it.  Hear 'em yelling!"
</p>

<p>
Robin looked with unseeing eyes at the admiring
sympathizers grouped round him.  Friendly fingers
rubbed him back to a dim idea of his surroundings, but
for the remainder of the game he was rather a wan and
woebegone passenger.  He struggled on, but when
"time" was called, and the referee ordered the teams
to go straight on for an extra fifteen minutes' play each
way, Dick and Lyon made a chair of their arms and
carried the small hero to the dressing-room, feeling
proud, for his sake, of the sympathetic cheers which
accompanied his exit.
</p>

<p>
"Give my neck a bit of a rub, Forge, and I'll carry
on," said Robin, in a faint voice.
</p>

<p>
"No, you won't, kid," said Forge, gently pinching
his ear.  "You'll rest your head against this
cushion&mdash;so&mdash;and sip the warm stuff that's offered you."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but you'll only have ten men without
me," stammered Robin.  He made a feeble attempt
to rise, while two kind hands held him firmly in his
place.
</p>

<p>
"That's all in the game, younker.  Don't dare to
get out of this chair till we return.  You've done your
bit already by scoring that fine equalizer."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, Forge, I didn't score it.  It bounced off me!"
</p>

<p>
The captain smilingly patted his arm.  "Keep that
dark, nipper," he advised.  "Never mind how it
happened.  The score is all that matters!"
</p>

<p>
To face extra time with a strong sun in their eyes
and a man short was quite on a par with Foxenby's
usual luck.  Shrill-voiced enthusiasts urged them to
play the one-back game, but Dick's idea of football
sportsmanship made such advice a waste of breath.  He
let Lyon, Ennis, and Lebberston hold the fort for a
furious fifteen minutes; the only quarter-of-an-hour
of the match in which the St. Cuthbert's forwards ever
made workmanlike attempts to score.  Ennis battered
away a dozen or more stinging shots, and the sorely
tried teams, keyed up to a high pitch of excitement by
the roaring of the crowd, commenced the last fifteen
minutes at a pitilessly exhausting pace.
</p>

<p>
The Octopus, usually so silent, shouted out directions
to his halves and forwards&mdash;tried, in fact, to lift
them on to victory by the sheer force of example.
</p>

<p>
Twice he attempted to catch Ennis napping by
shooting for goal himself, but the sun was no longer
bothering Ennis, who cleared with vigour.  It was the
second of these big clearances which fell at the feet of
Osbody, and that loyal young gentleman, slavishly
obeying instructions, parted with his prize at once to
Dick, past whom the Octopus had rushed in his
praise-worthy endeavour to score.
</p>

<p>
"Offside!" yelled half-a-dozen Cuthbertian players
in chorus.  "Offside, sir!" they repeated, as the
referee made no sign.  "Whistle there, please!"
</p>

<p>
It is this insistence on teaching the referee his
business which costs so many teams dear.  While
Cuthbertians called reproachfully to the referee, Dick
galloped on unchallenged, with painful memories of the
earlier final tie serving to speed his footsteps.
</p>

<p>
No half-witted "mascot" in blue-and-white paper
costume to cut across his path this time!  But he had
still to pass Bessingham's partner, and that
less-resourceful full-back, angered by the referee's disregard
of what St. Cuthbert's considered a clear case of
offside, permitted his fury to outweigh his discretion.
Making no attempt to get the ball, he took a tigerish
spring at Dick and passionately kicked him off his feet
a full yard within the penalty-area.
</p>

<p>
"Steady, you rotter!" Dick could not help saying.
</p>

<p>
Never was there a more flagrant case for punishment,
and the referee inflicted it immediately.  His arm shot
out towards the penalty-mark, and a few moments
later he was firmly devoting himself to the hard task
of persuading the sore-headed Cuthbertians, still
pleading "offside", to form up behind the goal-line
till the spot-kick was taken.
</p>

<p>
"Get behind, boys," snapped Bessingham.  "Bawling
won't alter it.  Keep cool!"
</p>

<p>
Penalty-kicks are thrilling things at most times, but
the situation now was so "nervy" that Dick almost
wished that the duties of captaincy could be passed
on to someone else.  The difficulty was that Broome
had always hitherto taken penalty-kicks with success,
and Broome was mixing uselessly with the crowd
to-day.
</p>

<p>
Who, then, was to take the all-important kick?
Lyon, perhaps?  But the only goal of Lyon's career
had been scored that day against his own side.
Meynard or Lake?  Both these wingers had shown a
disposition to funk on big occasions, and could not be
depended on.  That kick was more precious to
Foxenby than the Koh-i-noor diamond would have
been, and must not be left to a chance lunge from an
inexperienced boot.
</p>

<p>
"The responsibility is clearly mine," Dick thought,
as he rubbed his bruised shins.  "No use shuffling
it.  I will take the kick myself."
</p>

<p>
What a moment of trial that was for the captain of
Foxenby!
</p>

<p>
The goalkeeper danced about to put him off his
shot, and the thud of his boots could be heard in the
breathless silence of the crowd.  Dick had an instinctive
contempt for all forms of parade, and the custodian's
ludicrous antics, intended to upset him, actually helped
to steady his nerves.  Drawing back one pace only, he
suddenly let fly, and a low shot flashed under the
goalie's feet as that too-animated Cuthbertian was
actually jumping in the air.
</p>

<p>
"It's in!" yelled Lyon, at the top of his voice.
"Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
Justice at last&mdash;poetic justice!  Dick Forge had
scored his long-deferred goal, and it was not in
St. Cuthbert's power to draw level in the few minutes that
remained for play.  Far from seeming likely to, they
were penned up in their own quarters for the rest of
the time, a spent force, beaten and knowing it.  To
Foxenby, finishing with ten men only, had gone the
hard-earned spoils of victory.
</p>

<p>
The referee's whistle blew for time&mdash;a shrill blast
that was sweeter than concert-music to Foxes
everywhere.  Then "snap" went the frayed ropes, and the
frantic crowd swarmed over the field to become closer
acquainted with the heroes of the match.
</p>

<p>
But Bessingham and Lyon, two stalwart young giants,
forestalled them there.  Tackling Dick, in Rugby
fashion, before he could escape, they hoisted him on
to their shoulders and carried him to the pavilion, where
Lady Maingay stood smilingly ready to present him
with the County Schools' Cup.  Meanwhile, his arms
grew hot in their sockets through the grabbing enthusiasts
who sought the honour of shaking a victor's hand.
Now and again a well-known face bobbed up in the
crowd to gladden him with smiling appreciation.
Roger Cayton, featherweight though he was, somehow
got near enough to wave before his eyes the latest issue
of the <i>Rooke's House Rag</i>.  Dick understood the inner
meaning of the sign, and the chums exchanged joyous
looks.  What happy days of co-editorship there would
be in the sunny days to come!
</p>

<p>
It was a crowded hour of glory for the Merry Men
and the Squirms too.  Sufficiently revived by this
time, Robin was hauled out of the dressing-room and
borne shoulder-high to the presentation ceremony.
The Squirms carried Osbody in the same way, and the
presence of the eager-faced youngsters was enjoyed by
the officials as a pleasant bit of by-play.
</p>

<p>
"Put me down, you chumps!" stormed Robin.
"You're shaking my teeth loose.  I <i>didn't</i> score that
equalizer.  It just hit my thick head and buzzed
back."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up about that, Robin," cried Little John.
"No need to tell everybody you fluked it.  You scored,
and that's enough!"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" said David of Doncaster.  "Hold him
right up, Merry Men, where everybody can see him.
Good old Robin!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Maingay, as wholeheartedly a supporter of
St. Cuthbert's as she was of Foxenby, made a tactful
speech that flattered both victors and vanquished.
Then she handed the bulged Cup (a veteran of twenty
seasons, older than any player who had battled for it
that day) to Foxenby's captain, who found making a
speech even harder than scoring a goal had been.
</p>

<p>
"Your ladyship&mdash;ladies and gentlemen&mdash;I am a
duffer at talking," he began, "but I am not afraid to
say that I'm the proudest chap in the county to-day."
(Cries of "Bravo, Forge!" "Played, sir!")  "There
never was a straw to choose between us and St. Cuthbert's,
but both sides couldn't win.  If old Bessingham
could have cut himself into two parts (laughter) and
had been a forward as well as a full-back, we never
should have won.  Bessingham is a marvel.  Bessingham
is a brick.  Three cheers for the Octopus and his
wonderful team, you Foxes!"
</p>

<p>
Say, you should have heard the Foxes, yell then!
The crowd joined in to a man, for everybody loved the
Octopus, even those whose skin had been scraped off
by his flying boots.  They called on him for a speech
now, and the reception he got when he drew up his
lanky form to make it was every bit as deafening as the
din that greeted Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Your ladyship, and ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad
the match ended as it did," he said.  ("Good old
Bessingham&mdash;real old sport!")  "Foxenby won the
Cup last year fair and square, and it was no wish of
mine that we should play again.  To-day they whacked
us beyond question.  ('Well said, Bess.')  Old Forge
was the 'daddy' of us all (laughter), long streets and
terraces ahead of any player on the field.  ('Excepting
you, Bess!')  No, not excepting me&mdash;good old Forge
had me skinned a mile at the finish.  (Lots more
laughter.)  How did he win the match? By turning
two raw nippers into footballers almost as Foxy as
himself (great cheering from the Merry Men and the
Squirms).  He outwitted us&mdash;made children of us.
Give him two Cups, gentlemen&mdash;he's won this one
twice!  Cuthbertians, three cheers for Forge, the better
captain of the better team."
</p>

<p>
So Dick got another rousing cheer on top of the first
one, and Foxes and Cuthbertians talk to this day of
how Forge and the Octopus clasped hands over the
Cup and were forthwith "horsed" in triumph all the
way from the football-field to the railway-station, so
that people who did not know either imagined them to
be victorious colleagues on the same side.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have my revenge on you yet, my honourable
opponent," said Bessingham, on parting.  "We shall
meet in conflict again."
</p>

<p>
"In the final of the English Cup, I hope," laughed
Dick, in reply.  "Till then, old friend, au revoir!"

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
